There was once upon a time a peasant-woman who had a daughter and a step-daughter.	meli ike pi mani ala li jo e meli lili tu.
The daughter had her own way in everything,	ona li pana e ijo mute tawa meli lili ona.
and whatever she did was right in her mother’s eyes; but the poor step-daughter had a hard time. Let her do what she would, she was always blamed,	taso ona li pana e ike taso tawa meli lili pi jan ante. ona li pilin e ni: meli ona li pona.
and got small thanks for all the trouble she took;	
nothing was right, everything wrong;	meli pi jan ante li ike li pali e ike ale.
and yet, if the truth were known, the girl was worth her weight in gold—she was so unselfish and good-hearted.	
But her step-mother did not like her, and the poor girl’s days were spent in weeping;	tenpo mute la meli lili pi jan ante li ike pilin. oko ona li telo li loje.
for it was impossible to live peacefully with the woman.	
The wicked shrew was determined to get rid of the girl by fair means or foul,	mama meli li ike kin!
and kept saying to her father:	mama meli li toki e ni tawa mama mije pi meli lili:
“Send her away, old man; send her away—	“jan pi sin ala o weka e ona.
anywhere so that my eyes sha’n’t be plagued any longer by the sight of her,	mi wile ala lukin e ona
or my ears tormented by the sound of her voice.	li wile ala kute e toki ona.
Send her out into the fields,	o weka e ona tan tomo ni.”
and let the cutting frost do for her.”	
	
In vain did the poor old father weep and implore her pity;	mama mije li wile awen e meli lili ona.
she was firm,	taso meli ike li wile wawa weka e ona.
and he dared not gainsay her.	mije li ken ala toki utala tawa meli ona la
So he placed his daughter in a sledge, not even daring to give her a horse-cloth to keep herself warm with, and drove her out on to the bare, open fields, where he kissed her and left her, driving home as fast as he could, that he might not witness her miserable death.	ona li pana e meli lili ona tawa poki tawa li tawa ma suli. mije li weka e meli lili ona lon ni li pana ala e len seli tawa ona. ona li uta lili e meli lili ona li tawa weka. oko ona li telo. taso ona li lukin monsi ala.
	
Deserted by her father, the poor girl sat down under a fir-tree at the edge of the forest and began to weep silently.	meli lili li tawa selo pi ma kasi li anpa, lon poka kasi li telo tan oko.
Suddenly she heard a faint sound:	ona li lukin sewi tan kalama.
it was King Frost	ona li lukin e jan lawa lete.
springing from tree to tree,	jan lawa lete li tawa sewi pi kasi wan li tawa sewi pi kasi ante.
and cracking his fingers as he went.	
At length he reached the fir-tree beneath which she was sitting,	ona li lon kasi pi meli lili la
and with a crisp crackling sound he alighted beside her, and looked at her lovely face.	ona li anpa. ona li kama e lete lon sinpin pi meli lili li toki e ni:
	
“Well, maiden,” he snapped out, “do you know who I am?	“sina sona ala sona e mi?
I am King Frost, king of the red-noses.”	mi jan lawa lete.”
	
“All hail to you, great King!” answered the girl,	meli lili li toki e ni: “jan lawa wawa o, sina pona!”
in a gentle, trembling voice.	uta ona li lupa lukin.
“Have you come to take me?”	“sina tawa ala tawa e mi?”
	
“Are you warm, maiden?” he replied.	jan lawa lete li toki e ni: “meli pona o, sina seli ala seli?”
	
“Quite warm, King Frost,” she answered,	meli lili li toki e ni: “seli. jan lawa lete o, mi seli mute.”
though she shivered as she spoke.	taso selo ona li tawa lili.
	
Then King Frost stooped down, and bent over the girl, and the crackling sound grew louder,	jan lawa lete li kama e lete, lon poka ona.
and the air seemed to be full of knives and darts;	kon li lete mute.
and again he asked:	ona li toki sin e ni:
	
“Maiden, are you warm? Are you warm, you beautiful girl?”	“meli pona o, sina seli ala seli?”
	
And though her breath was almost frozen on her lips,	uta pi meli lili li ken ala tawa suli.
she whispered gently, “Quite warm, King Frost.”	ona li toki e ni: “jan lawa lete o, mi seli.”
	
Then King Frost gnashed his teeth, and cracked his fingers, and his eyes sparkled, and the crackling, crisp sound was louder than ever,	jan lawa lete li kama e lete suli wawa. kon li lete mute kin! oko ona li suno musi.
and for the last time he asked her:	ona li toki e ni:
	
“Maiden, are you still warm?	“meli pona o, sina seli ala seli?
Are you still warm, little love?”	tenpo ni la sina awen ala awen seli?”
	
And the poor girl was so stiff and numb	meli lili li ken ala toki mute tan lete.
that she could just gasp,	taso ona li kama jo e kon lili li toki e ni:
“Still warm, O King!”	“jan lawa lete o, mi awen seli.”
	
Now her gentle, courteous words and her uncomplaining ways touched King Frost,	meli lili li awen pona li toki utala ala.
and he had pity on her,	tan ni la jan lawa lete li pana e pona tawa ona.
and he wrapped her up in furs, and covered her with blankets, and he fetched a great box, in which were beautiful jewels and a rich robe embroidered in gold and silver. And she put it on, and looked more lovely than ever, and King Frost stepped with her into his sledge, with six white horses.	ona li len e meli lili kepeken len mani suli pi kiwen walo en kiwen jelo. meli lili li suno mute li pona lukin. jan lawa lete li pana e ona tawa poki tawa ona li pana e len seli soweli tawa ona. soweli suli luka wan li tawa e poki tawa ona kepeken tenpo lili.
	
In the meantime the wicked step-mother was waiting at home for news of the girl’s death,	mama meli ike li lon tomo
and preparing pancakes	li pali e moku sike.
for the funeral feast.	ona li weka e sijelo pi meli lili la ona li wile jo e moku mute.
And she said to her husband:	ona li toki e ni tawa mije ona:
“Old man, you had better go out into the fields	“o tawa ma suli.
and find your daughter’s body and bury her.”	o kama jo e sijelo pi meli lili sina.”
Just as the old man was leaving the house	mije li kama tawa.
the little dog under the table began to bark, saying:	taso soweli pi lon anpa supa li mu e ni tawa ona:
	
“YOUR daughter shall live to be your delight; HER daughter shall die this very night.”	“meli lili sina li moli ala. meli lili ona li moli wawa.”
	
“Hold your tongue, you foolish beast!” scolded the woman. “There’s a pancake for you, but you must say:	meli ike li pakala e soweli li pana e moku sike tawa ona. meli li toki e ni: “o toki e ni tawa mije mi:
	
‘HER daughter shall have much silver and gold; HIS daughter is frozen quite stiff and cold.’”	‘meli lili sina li moli lete. meli lili ona li jo e mani mute.’”
	
But the doggie ate up the pancake and barked, saying:	soweli li pini moku la ona li mu e ni tawa meli ike:
	
“His daughter shall wear a crown on her head; Her daughter shall die unwooed, unwed.”	“meli lili ona li jo e mije. meli lili sina li moli lete.”
	
Then the old woman tried to coax the doggie with more pancakes and to terrify it with blows,	meli ike li pakala sin e soweli li pana e moku sin tawa ona.
but he barked on,	taso ni li suli ala tawa soweli.
always repeating the same words.	ona li awen mu sama.
And suddenly the door creaked and flew open,	lupa tomo li open.
and a great heavy chest was pushed in, and behind it came the step-daughter, radiant and beautiful, in a dress all glittering with silver and gold. For a moment the step-mother’s eyes were dazzled. Then she called to her husband:	poki suli pi mani jelo mute li tawa insa tomo. meli lili pona li kama. ona li jo e len suno pona. mama tu li lukin e ona. mama meli ike li sona e kama la ona li toki e ni tawa mije ona:
“Old man, yoke the horses at once into the sledge, and take my daughter to the same field and leave her on the same spot exactly;”	“tenpo pini la sina weka e meli lili sina tawa ma suli. o weka e meli lili mi tawa ma suli sama.”
and so the old man took the girl and left her beneath the same tree where he had parted from his daughter.	mije li weka e meli lili li tawa tomo ona.
In a few minutes King Frost came past, and, looking at the girl,	tenpo lili la jan lawa lete li kama.
he said:	ona li toki e ni:
	
“Are you warm, maiden?”	“meli lili o, sina seli ala seli?”
	
“What a blind old fool you must be to ask such a question!” she answered angrily. “Can’t you see that my hands and feet are nearly frozen?”	meli lili li toki utala e ni: “noka mi en luka mi li lete kin! sina sona ala e ni la sina jan nasa!”
	
Then King Frost sprang to and fro in front of her, questioning her,	jan lawa lete li tawa musi, lon poka ona li kama e lete li awen toki e ni: “meli lili o, sina seli ala seli?”
and getting only rude, rough words in reply, till at last he got very angry, and cracked his fingers, and gnashed his teeth, and froze her to death.	meli lili li kalama utala li toki e nimi ike tawa jan lawa lete. jan lawa lete li lete e nimi pi lon uta ona. ona li moli lete.
	
But in the hut her mother was waiting for her return, and as she grew impatient she said to her husband:	mama meli li awen lon tomo. ona li toki e ni tawa mije ona:
“Get out the horses, old man, to go and fetch her home;	“o kama jo e meli lili mi.
but see that you are careful not to upset the sledge and lose the chest.”	taso o kama jo e poki suli mani kin.”
	
But the doggie beneath the table began to bark, saying:	soweli pi lon anpa supa li mu e ni:
	
“Your daughter is frozen quite stiff and cold, And shall never have a chest full of gold.”	“meli lili sina li lete li moli li wile ala e poki suli mani.”
	
“Don’t tell such wicked lies!” scolded the woman.	meli ike li pakala e soweli.
“There’s a cake for you; now say: ‘HER daughter shall marry a mighty King.’”	
	
At that moment the door flew open,	lupa tomo li open.
and she rushed out to meet her daughter,	ona li tawa meli lili ona li tawa mani ona.
and as she took her frozen body in her arms	ona li jo e sijelo lete kepeken luka.
she too was chilled to death.	lete sijelo li moli e meli ike kin.
