One evening, after eating a hearty meal, Māui lay beside his fire staring into the flames.	tenpo pimeja wan la jan Mawi li anpa, lon poka pi seli ona li lukin e seli.
He watched the flames flicker and dance	seli li tawa nasa li tawa musi.
and thought to himself, “I wonder where fire comes from.”	jan Mawi li pilin e ni: “seli li kama tan seme?”
	
Māui, being the curious person that he was, decided that he needed to find out.	jan Mawi li jan pi wile sona.
In the middle of the night,	tenpo pimeja la
while everyone was sleeping,	jan ante li lape la
Māui went from village to village and extinguished all the fires	jan Mawi li tawa ma ale li telo e seli ale.
until not a single fire burned in the world.	seli li lon ala.
He then went back to his whare and waited.	jan Mawi li tawa tomo ona li awen.
	
The next morning there was an uproar in the village.	tenpo suno kama la jan ale li kalama mute.
	
“How can we cook our breakfast, there’s no fire!” called a worried mother.	mama wan li toki e ni: “mi ken seli e moku kepeken nasin seme? seli li lon ala!”
	
“How will we keep warm at night?” cried another.	mama ante li toki e ni: “mi awen seli lon tenpo pimeja lete kepeken nasin seme?”
	
“We can’t possibly live without fire!” the villagers said to one another.	jan ale li toki e ni: “seli li lon ala la mi ale li ken ala lon!”
	
The people of the village were very frightened.	jan pi ma tomo li ike pilin mute.
They asked Taranga, who was their rangatira, to help solve the problem.	ona li toki e ni tawa jan lawa Talana: “mi mute li pali e seme?”
	
“Someone will have to go and see the great goddess, Mahuika, and ask her for fire,” said Taranga.	jan lawa Talana li toki e ni: “jan li wile tawa meli sewi suli Mapuwika li wile kama jo e seli tan ona.”
	
None of the villagers were eager to meet Mahuika,	jan ala li wile tawa meli Mapuwika tan ni:
they had all heard of the scorching mountain where she lived.	meli Mapuwika li lon nena suli seli.
So Māui offered to set out in search of Mahuika,	taso jan Mawi li tawa meli Mapuwika.
secretly glad that his plan had worked.	ona li pona pilin lon insa tan ni: ona li ken kama sona e tan pi seli ale.
	
“Be very careful,” said Taranga.	jan lawa Talana li toki e ni. “tawa pona! pali pona!
“Although you are a descendant of Mahuika	meli Mapulika li mama pi kulupu mama sina.
she will not take kindly to you if you try and trick her.”	taso sina ike tawa ona la ona li ike tawa sina.”
	
“I’ll find the great ancestress Mahuika and bring fire back to the world,” Māui assured his mother.	jan Mawi li toki e ni tawa mama ona: “mi tawa meli mama suli Mapuwika li pana e seli tawa ma.”
	
Māui walked to the scorching mountain to the end of the earth	jan Mawi li tawa nena suli seli lon pini ma
following the instructions from his mother	kepeken toki pi mama ona.
and found a huge mountain glowing red hot with heat.	
At the base of the mountain Māui saw a cave entrance.	ona li lukin e lupa lon anpa nena.
Before he entered, Māui whispered a special karakia to himself as protection from what lay beyond.	ona li toki sewi kepeken kalama lili tan ni: ona li wile awen lon.
But nothing could prepare Māui for what he saw when he entered the sacred mountain of Mahuika.	taso ona li tawa lupa la ijo suli wawa li lon.
	
Mahuika, the goddess, rose up before him,	meli sewi Mapuwika li tawa sewi.
fire burning from every pore of her body,	sijelo ona li seli.
her hair a mass of flames,	linja lawa ona li seli.
her arms outstretched,	luka ona li open.
and with only black holes where her eyes once were.	oko ona li lon ala li lupa pimeja taso.
She sniffed the air.	ona li kama jo e kon.
	
“Who is this mortal that dares to enter my dwelling?”	ona li toki e ni: “sina lon tomo mi a. jan ma ni li jan seme?”
	
Māui gathered the courage to speak, “It is I, Māui, son of Taranga.”	jan Mawi li toki e ni: “mi jan Mawi pi jan Talana.”
	
“Huh!” Yelled Mahuika. “Māui, the son of Taranga?”	meli Mapuwika li toki suli e ni. “a! sina jan Mawi pi jan Talana anu seme?”
	
“Yes the last born, Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga.”	“a! jan sama ale mi li suli tawa mi. mi jan Mawi Sikisiki A Talana.”
	
	meli Mapuwika li toki e ni.
“Well then, Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga, welcome, welcome to the essence of the flame,	“o sina kama pona tawa ma pi seli ale!
welcome my grandchild.”	jan lili pi jan lili mi o kama pona.”
	
Mahuika stepped closer to Māui, taking a deep sniff of his scent.	meli Mapuwika li tawa jan Mawi li kama jo e kon ona.
Māui stood completely still,	jan Mawi li awen.
even though the flames from Mahuika’s skin were unbearably hot.	taso seli pi meli Mapuwija li seli mute!
	
“So… why do you come, Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga?” Mahuika finally asked.	meli Mapuwija li toki e ni: “sina kama tan seme?”
	
Māui said,	jan Mawi li toki e ni:
“The fires of the world have been extinguished,	“seli li lon ala ma.
I have come to ask you for fire.”	mi kama tan ni: mi wile e seli.”
Mahuika listened carefully to Māui, and then she laughed.	meli Mapuwika li kute pona e toki pi jan Mawi li toki musi e nimi. “a a a!”
She pulled a fingernail from one of her burning fingers and gave it to him.	ona li pana e selo pi palisa luka wan tawa jan Mawi.
	
	ona li toki e ni:
“Take this fire as a gift to your people.	“o pana e seli ni tawa kulupu sina.
Honour this fire as you honour me.”	o pilin e ni: seli ni li suli sama mi.”
	
So Māui left the house of Mahuika taking with him the fingernail of fire.	jan Mawi li jo e selo seli li tawa weka.
	
As Māui walked along the side of the road he thought to himself,	jan Mawi li tawa lon nasin la ona li pilin e ni:
“What if Mahuika had no fire left, then where would she get her fire from?”	“meli Mapuwika li jo ala e seli la ona li kama jo e seli sin tan ma seme?”
	
Māui couldn’t contain his curiosity.	jan Mawi li jan pi wile sona.
He quickly threw the fingernail into a stream and headed back to Mahuika’s cave.	ona li weka e selo lon telo tawa li tawa tomo pi meli Mapuwika.
	
“I tripped and fell,” said Māui.	jan Mawi li toki e ni: “mi tawa li anpa a.
“Could I please have another?”	o pana e selo sin tawa mi.”
	
Mahuika was in a good mood.	meli Mapuwika li pona pilin.
She hadn’t spoken to someone in quite some time	tenpo suli la ona li toki ala tawa jan.
and she liked Māui.	jan Mawi li pona tawa ona.
She gladly gave Māui another of her fingernails.	ona li pana e selo sin tawa jan Mawi.
	
But Māui soon extinguished this fingernail as well	taso jan Mawi li telo e selo ni kin
and returned to Mahuika with another excuse.	li tawa meli Mapuwika li toki e ni:
	
“A fish splashed my flame as I was crossing the river,” Māui said.	“mi tawa lon telo tawa la kala li pana e telo tawa seli mi.”
	
Mahuika provided another of her fingernails, not suspecting that she was being tricked.	meli Mapuwika li pana e selo sin li pilin ala e ni: jan Mawi li toki e ijo pi lon ala.
	
This continued for most of the day	jan Mawi li awen pali sama ni.
until Mahuika had used all her fingernails and had even given up her toenails.	meli Mapuwika li pana e selo ale pi palisa luka ona e selo mute pi palisa noka ona.
When Māui returned to ask for another, Mahuika was furious.	jan Mawi li kama sin li wile e selo sin la meli Mapuwika li ike pilin mute.
She knew Māui had been tricking her	ona li sona e ni: jan Mawi li toki e ijo pi lon ala.
and threw the burning toenail to the ground.	ona li weka anpa e selo wan pi palisa noka.
	
Instantly Māui was surrounded by fire and chased from the cave.	seli li sike e jan Mawi. jan Mawi li tawa weka.
	
Māui changed himself into a hawk and escaped to the sky,	ona li kama waso wawa li tawa sewi.
but the flames burned so high that they singed the underside of his wings,	taso seli li suli mute li seli e anpa pi selo ona.
turning them a glowing red.	
	
Māui dived towards a river, hoping to avoid the flames in the coolness of the water,	jan Mawi li tawa telo tawa li kama kala.
but the immense heat made the water boil.	taso seli li seli wawa e telo.
	
Māui was desperate. He called on his ancestor Tāwhirimātea for help.	jan Mawi li toki tawa mama Tapilimateja pi tenpo pini.
“Tāwhirimātea atua o ngā hau e whā, āwhinatia mai!”	“jan sewi wawa pi kon en sewi o pana e pona tawa mi!”
	
Then, a mass of clouds gathered and a torrent of rain fell to put out the many fires.	kon mute li kama li pana wawa e telo mute, tawa ma, tawa seli.
Mahuika’s mountain of fire no longer burned hot.	nena suli pi meli Mapuwika li seli ala.
	
Mahuika had lost much of her power,	meli Mapuwika li jo ala e wawa mute.
but still she was not giving up.	taso ona li awen pali.
She took her very last toenail and threw it at Māui in anger.	ona li weka e selo seli pini tawa jan Mawi.
The toenail of fire missed Māui and flew into the trees,	selo li tawa ala jan Mawi li tawa kasi.
planting itself in the Mahoe tree,	ona li lon insa kasi Mapo
the Tōtara,	li lon kasi Totala
the Patete,	li lon kasi Patete
the Pukatea,	li lon kasi Pukateja
and the Kaikōmako trees.	li lon kasi Kawikomako.
These trees cherished and held onto the fire of Mahuika, considering it a great gift.	kasi ni li pona pilin li pilin e ni: seli pi meli Mapuwika li ijo suli.
	
When Māui returned to his village	jan Mawi li tawa ma tomo ona la
he didn’t bring back fire as the villagers had expected.	ona li jo ala e seli.
Instead he brought back dry wood from the Kaikōmako tree	taso ona li jo e luka pi kasi Kawimako
and showed them how to rub the dry sticks together forming friction which would eventually start a fire.	li pana e sona pi open seli tawa jan pi ma tomo.
The villagers were very happy	jan pi ma tomo li pona pilin mute tan ni:
to be able to cook their food once more	ona li ken seli e moku
and to have the warmth of their fires at night to comfort them.	li ken awen seli lon tenpo pimeja lete.
	
Māui satisfied his curiosity in finding the origin of fire,	jan Mawi li jan sona.
although he very nearly paid the ultimate price in doing so.	taso ante li kama la ken la jan Mawi li moli.
To this day the Kahu, the native hawk of Aotearoa, still retains the red singed feathers on the underside of its wings,	selo anpa pi waso wawa Kapu pi ma Ajotejalowa li loje tan ni:
a reminder of how close Māui was to death.	tenpo pini la jan Mawi li ken moli.
	
This is the story of how Māui brought fire to the world.	ni li toki ni: jan Mawi li pana e seli tawa ma.
