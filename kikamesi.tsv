PROLOGUE: GILGAMESH KING IN URUK	jan Kikamesi li jan lawa pi ma tomo Uluku
	
I will proclaim to the world the deeds of Gilgamesh. This was the man to whom all things were known; this was the king who knew the countries of the world. He was wise, he saw mysteries and knew secret things, he brought us a tale of the days before the flood. He went on a long journey, was weary, worn-out with labour, returning he rested, he engraved on a stone the whole story.	
	
In Uruk	ma tomo Uluku li lon.
he built walls, a great rampart,	sinpin pi ma tomo Uluku li sewi li suli. sinpin ni li kiwen.
and the temple of blessed Eanna for the god of the firmament Anu, and for Ishtar the goddess of love.	tomo Enana li tomo pi sewi meli Inana.
Look at it still today: the outer wall where the cornice runs, it shines with the brilliance of copper; and the inner wall, it has no equal. Touch the threshold, it is ancient. Approach Eanna the dwelling of Ishtar, our lady of love and war,	sinpin pi tomo Enana li kiwen. sinpin ni li walo sama suno. o tawa tomo pi sewi meli Inana! o lukin!
the like of which no latter-day king, no man alive can equal.	jan ante li pali ala e tomo sama. jan lawa ante li pali ala e tomo sama.
Climb upon the wall of Uruk; walk along it, I say; regard the foundation terrace and examine the masonry: is it not burnt brick and good?	jan seme li kama pali e ali ni?
The seven sages laid the foundations.	
	jan Kikamesi li jan lawa pi ma tomo Uluku. ona li kama pali e tomo sewi ni e sinpin ni.
[Gilgamesh was] terrifying like a great wild bull.	ona li suli. jan Kikamesi li utala sama soweli wawa. ona li pakala e sinpin kiwen.
	ona li lawa e kulupu pi jan utala ona. ona li jan lawa. jan seme li ken sama ona? jan seme li ken toki e ni: “mi jan lawa”?
When the gods created Gilgamesh they gave him a perfect body. Shamash the glorious sun endowed him with beauty, Adad the god of the storm endowed him with courage.	sewi meli Ninsun en jan lawa Lukapanta li mama ona. taso sewi mama Alulu li pona e sijelo ona.
Two thirds they made him god and one third man.	wan ona wan li jan. wan ona tu li sewi.
The great gods made his beauty perfect,	ona li suli li pona lukin.
surpassing all others.	jan Kikamesi li wawa li sama sewi.
	
1 THE COMING OF ENKIDU	
	
Gilgamesh went abroad in the world, but he met with none who could withstand his arms till be came to Uruk.	jan ala li wile utala e ona.
But the men of Uruk muttered in their houses,	jan pi ma tomo Uluku li pilin ike tan jan Kikamesi. jan mute li tawa tomo pi jan sewi li toki e ni:
‘Gilgamesh sounds the tocsin for his amusement, his arrogance has no bounds by day or night.	“sewi o! jan Kikamesi li suli li sona. ona li wawa. nimi ona li suli.
No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all, even the children;	jan Kikamesi li kulupu e mije la ona li lawa e jan ni tawa utala. tan ni la mama mute li pilin ike.
yet the king should be a shepherd to his people.	jan Kikamesi li jan lawa pi pona ala anu seme?
His lust leaves no virgin to her lover,	jan Kikamesi li kama jo e meli li unpa e ona.
neither the warrior’s daughter nor the wife of the noble;	tan ni la mama mute li pana e telo oko.
yet this is the shepherd of the city, wise, comely, and resolute.’	jan Kikamesi li jan lawa pi pona ala anu seme?”
	
	jan soweli Enkitu
	
The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven cried to the Lord of Uruk, to Anu the god of Uruk: ‘A goddess made him, strong as a savage bull, none can withstand his arms. No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all; and is this the king, the shepherd of his people? His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior’s daughter nor the wife of the noble.’	sewi li kute e ni. sewi An li lawa e sewi.
When Anu had heard their lamentation the gods cried to Aruru, the goddess of creation,	ona li toki e ni tawa mama sewi Alulu:
‘You made him, O Aruru;	“tenpo pini la sina pali e jan.
now create his equal; let it be as like him as his own reflection, his second self; stormy heart for stormy heart.	o pali e jan wawa sin. o pali e jan pi sama jan Kikamesi.
Let them contend together	mi wile e ni: ona li utala e jan Kikamesi.
and leave Uruk in quiet.’	tan ni la jan pi ma tomo Uluku li ken awen pona.”
	
So the goddess conceived an image in her mind, and it was of the stuff of Anu of the firmament. She dipped her hands in water	mama sewi Alulu li telo e luka.
and pinched off clay, she let it fall in the wilderness,	ona li kama jo e ko telo li pana e ijo ni tawa ma supa.
and noble Enkidu was created.	nasin ni la jan Enkitu li kama lon.
There was virtue in him of the god of war, of Ninurta himself.	jan Enkitu li suli li wawa.
His body was rough, he had long hair like a woman’s; it waved like the hair of Nisaba, the goddess of corn. His body was covered with matted hair like Samugan’s, the god of cattle.	sijelo ona li jo e linja mute.
Enkidu ate grass in the hills with the gazelle and lurked with wild beasts at the water-holes; he had joy of the water with the herds of wild game.	ona en soweli li moku e kasi anpa. ona en soweli li moku e telo.
He was innocent of mankind; he knew nothing of the cultivated land.	jan Enkitu li jan soweli. ona li sona ala e ilo e tomo e jan ante.
	
	jan pi alasa soweli
	
But there was a trapper	jan pi alasa soweli li lon ma ni. ona li pali e lupa ma suli. soweli li tawa insa lupa la jan ni li ken kama jo e ona. jan li pali e ilo alasa kin. ona li kama jo e soweli li moli e ona.
	taso jan soweli Enkitu li pakala e lupa ni e ilo ni. ona li kama e ni: soweli li ken tawa weka.
who met him one day face to face at the drinking-hole, for the wild game had entered his territory. On three days he met him face to face, and the trapper was frozen with fear.	jan pi alasa soweli li lukin e jan Enkitu wawa li pilin ike li wawa ala pilin.
He went back to his house with the game that he had caught, and he was dumb, benumbed with terror. His face was altered like that of one who has made a long journey.	ona li tawa weka li tawa mama ona.
With awe in his heart he spoke to his father:	jan pi alasa soweli li toki e ni:
‘Father, there is a man, unlike any other, who comes down from the hills.	“mama o, jan soweli li kama tan ma nena.
He is the strongest in the world, he is like an immortal from heaven.	ona li suli li wawa. jan ala li wawa sama ona.
I am afraid and dare not go near him.	mi pilin ike.
He ranges over the hills with wild beasts and eats grass;	ona en soweli li moku e kasi anpa.
he ranges through your land and comes down to the wells.	ona en soweli li moku e telo.
He fills in the pits which I dig and tears up-my traps set for the game;	tenpo ali la ona li pakala e lupa ma mi e ilo mi.
he helps the beasts to escape and now they slip through my fingers.’	mi ken ala kama jo e soweli tan ona.”
	
His father opened his mouth and said to the trapper,	mama li toki e ni:
‘My son, in Uruk lives Gilgamesh;	“jan lili mi o, jan Kikamesi li lon ma tomo Uluku.
no one has ever prevailed against him, he is strong as a star from heaven.	jan ala li wawa sama ona.
Go to Uruk,	o tawa! o kama tawa ma tomo Uluku.
find Gilgamesh, extol the strength of this wild man.	o toki e ijo pi jan wawa ni tawa jan Kikamesi.
Ask him to give you a harlot, a wanton from the temple of love;	jan Kikamesi li pana e meli unpa Sanka tawa sina.
return with her, and let her woman’s power overpower this man. When next he comes down to drink at the wells she will be there, stripped naked; and when he sees her beckoning he will embrace her, and then the wild beasts will reject him.’	tenpo kama la jan Sanka li anpa e jan soweli ni kepeken unpa.”
	
So the trapper set out on his journey to Uruk	jan pi alasa soweli li kama tawa ma tomo Uluku.
and addressed himself to Gilgamesh saying, ‘A man unlike any other is roaming now in the pastures; he is as strong as a star from heaven and I am afraid to approach him. He helps the wild game to escape; he fills in my pits and pulls up my traps.’	jan Kikamesi li kute e ona
Gilgamesh said,	li toki e ni:
‘Trapper, go back, take with you a harlot, a child of pleasure.	“jan pi alasa soweli o kama jo e meli unpa Sanka pi tomo pi jan sewi.
At the drinking hole she will strip, and when, he sees her beckoning he will embrace her	tenpo kama la ona li kepeken nasin meli tawa jan soweli ni.
and the game of the wilderness will surely reject him.’	tenpo lili kama la soweli pi jan ni li tawa weka tan ona.”
	
	meli pi tomo pi jan sewi
	
Now the trapper returned, taking the harlot [Shamhat] with him.	jan pi alasa soweli en jan Sanka li tawa ma supa.
After a three days’ journey they came to the drinking hole,	tenpo suno pi mute lili pini la ona li kama lon ma supa.
and there they sat down; the harlot and the trapper sat facing one another and waited for the game to come. For the first day and for the second day the two sat waiting,	ona li awen.
but on the third day the herds came; they came down to drink and Enkidu was with them.	tenpo suno sin la soweli en jan soweli Enkitu li kama.
The small wild creatures of the plains were glad of the water, and Enkidu with them, who ate grass with the gazelle and was born in the hills;	jan soweli Enkitu li moku e telo e kasi anpa poka soweli. telo en kasi anpa li pona tawa ona.
and she saw him, the savage man, come from far-off in the hills.	jan Sanka li lukin e jan soweli Enkitu li kama tawa ona.
	
The trapper spoke to her: ‘There he is. Now, woman, make your breasts bare, have no shame, do not delay but welcome his love. Let him see you naked, let him possess your body. When he comes near uncover yourself and lie with him; teach him, the savage man, your woman’s art, for when he murmurs love to you the wild’ beasts that shared his life in the hills will reject him.’	
	
She was not ashamed to take him, she made herself naked and welcomed his eagerness; as he lay on her murmuring love she taught him the woman’s art.	meli li weka e len sama. jan Sanka li pilin e luka pi jan soweli Enkitu. meli Sanka li unpa e mije Enkitu. mije Enkitu li unpa e meli Sanka.
For six days and seven nights they lay together, for Enkidu had forgotten his home in the hills;	tenpo suno mute la ona li unpa. tenpo pimeja mute la ona li unpa.
but when he was satisfied he went back to the wild beasts.	ona li pini unpa la jan Enkitu li lukin tawa soweli.
Then, when the gazelle saw him, they bolted away; when the wild creatures saw him they fled.	taso soweli li pilin ike tawa ona. tan ni la soweli li tawa weka.
Enkidu would have followed,	jan Enkitu li wile tawa soweli.
but his body was bound as though with a cord, his knees gave way when he started to run, his swiftness was gone. And now the wild creatures had all fled away; Enkidu was grown weak,	taso ona li wawa ala pilin. ona li ken ala tawa wawa.
for wisdom was in him,	jan Enkitu li kama pilin e ni: ona li ken sona.
and the thoughts of a man were in his heart.	jan Enkitu li pilin e ni: “mi ken sona. mi pilin. mi jan.”
So he returned and sat down at the woman’s feet,	ona li kama tawa jan Sanka li anpa.
and listened intently	ona li lukin e sinpin ona li kute.
to what she said.	jan Sanka li toki tawa jan Enkitu. ona li toki e ni:
‘You are wise, Enkidu,	“jan Enkitu o!
and now you have become like a god.	sina sama sewi.
Why do you want to run wild with the beasts in the hills?	sina tawa poka soweli tan seme?
Come with me. I will take you to strong-walled Uruk, to the blessed temple of Ishtar and of Anu, of love and of heaven there Gilgamesh lives, who is very strong, and like a wild bull he lords it over men.’	o kama.”
	
When she had spoken Enkidu was pleased; he longed for a comrade, for one who would understand his heart. ‘Come, woman, and take me to that holy temple, to the house of Anu and of Ishtar, and to the place where Gilgamesh lords it over the people. I will challenge him boldly, I will cry out aloud in Uruk, “I am the strongest here, I have come to change the old order, I am he who was born in the hills, I am he who is strongest of all.”’	
	
She said, ‘Let us go, and let him see your face. I know very well where Gilgamesh is in great Uruk. O Enkidu, there all the people are dressed in their gorgeous robes, every day is holiday, the young men and the girls are wonderful to see. How sweet they smell! All the great ones are roused from their beds. O Enkidu, you who love life, I will show you Gilgamesh, a man of many moods; you shall look at him well in his radiant manhood. His body is perfect in strength and maturity; he never rests by night or day. He is stronger than you, so leave your boasting. Shamash the glorious sun has given favours to Gilgamesh, and Anu of the heavens, and Enlil, and Ea the wise has given him deep understanding. I tell you, even before you have left the wilderness, Gilgamesh will know in his dreams that you are coming.’	
	
	sitelen lape pi jan Kikamesi
	
Now Gilgamesh got up to tell his dream to his mother; Ninsun, one of the wise gods.	jan Kikamesi li lukin lape. ona li pini lape li tawa mama meli. jan Kikamesi li toki e ni:
‘Mother, last night I had a dream.	“mama o! tenpo pimeja la mi jo e sitelen lape.
I was full of joy, the young heroes were round me and I walked through the night under the stars of the firmament,	mi lukin e mun lili mute lon sewi mi.
and one, a meteor of the stuff of Anu, fell down from heaven.	mun pi sewi An li anpa lon poka mi.
I tried to lift it	mi wile sewi e kiwen ni.
but it proved too heavy.	taso mi ken ala tawa e ona.
All the people of Uruk came round to see it, the common people jostled and the nobles thronged to kiss its feet;	jan pi ma tomo Uluku li sike e mun ni.
and to me its attraction was like the love of woman.	mi anpa tawa ona sama ni: mi anpa tawa meli.
They helped me, I braced my forehead and I raised it with thongs and brought it to you, and you yourself pronounced it my brother.’	mi toki e ijo ni tawa sina tawa ni: sina ken pana e sona pi sitelen lape ni.”
	
Then Ninsun, who is well-beloved and wise, said to Gilgamesh,	mama pi jan Kikamesi li sona e ali. sewi Ninsun li sona e ali. ona li sona e sitelen lape ni li toki e ni:
’This star of heaven which descended like a meteor from the sky; which you tried to lift, but found too heavy, when you tried to move it it would not budge, and so you brought it to my feet; I made it for you, a goad and spur, and you were drawn as though to a woman.	“mije lili mi o! sitelen lape sina li ni:
This is the strong comrade, the one who brings help to his friend in his need.	tenpo kama la jan wawa li kama tawa sina.
He is the strongest of wild creatures, the stuff of Anu; born in the grass-lands and the wild hills reared him;	ona li wawa sama mun pi sewi An.
when you see him you will be glad; you will love him as a woman and he will never forsake you.	tenpo kama la ona li pona tawa sina. ona li pana e pona tawa sina li utala e jan ike sina. ona li jan sama sina. sina olin e ona sama meli olin.
This is the meaning of the dream.’	mije lili o! sitelen lape sina li pona li suli.”
	
Gilgamesh said, ‘Mother, I dreamed a second dream. In the streets of strong-walled Uruk there lay an axe; the shape of it was strange and the people thronged round. I saw it and was glad. I bent down, deeply drawn towards it; I loved it like a woman and wore it at my side.’ Ninsun answered, ‘That axe, which you saw, which drew you so powerfully like love of a woman, that is the comrade whom I give you, and he will come in his strength like one of the host of heaven. He is the brave companion who rescues his friend in necessity.’ Gilgamesh said to his mother, ‘A friend, a counsellor has come to me from Enlil, and now I shall befriend and counsel him.’ So Gilgamesh told his dreams; and the harlot [Shamhat] retold them to Enkidu.	
	
And now she said to Enkidu, ‘When I look at you you have become like a god. Why do you yearn to run wild again with the beasts in the hills? Get up from the ground, the bed of a shepherd.’ He listened to her words with care. It was good advice that she gave.	
	
	jan Enkitu
	
She divided her clothing in two	jan Sanka li tu e len ona.
and with the one half she clothed him and with the other herself,	ona li len e jan Enkitu kepeken len wan.
and holding his hand she led him like a child to the sheepfolds,	jan Sanka li toki e ni: “o kama poka mi. o kama tawa kulupu jan.”
into the shepherds’ tents.	ona li tawa tomo pi jan pi lawa mani.
There all the shepherds crowded round to see him,	jan mute pi lawa pi mani mute li kulupu li lukin e jan Enkitu li toki e ni: “ona li suli sama jan Kikamesi. ona li wawa sama suno pi sewi An.”
they put down bread in front of him, but Enkidu could only suck the milk of wild animals.	ona li pana e pan e telo nasa jelo.
He fumbled and gaped, at a loss what to do or how he should eat the bread and drink the strong wine.	jan Enkitu li moku ala. ona li lukin wawa taso. tenpo ala la ona li lukin e pan e telo nasa.
Then the woman said,	jan Sanka li toki ni:
‘Enkidu, eat bread, it is the staff of life;	“jan Enkitu o moku e moku ni.
drink the wine,	o moku e telo ni.
it is the custom of the land.’	ni li nasin jan.”
So he ate till he was full	jan Enkitu li moku e pan mute.
and drank strong wine, seven goblets.	ona li moku e telo nasa jelo mute.
He became merry, his heart exulted and his face shone.	ona li pilin pona mute.
He rubbed down the matted hair of his body and anointed himself with oil.	ona li telo e sijelo ona.
Enkidu had become a man; but when he had put on man’s clothing he appeared like a bridegroom.	ona li len. jan Enkitu li jan kin.
He took arms to hunt the lion so that the shepherds could rest at night. He caught wolves and lions and the herdsmen lay down in peace; for Enkidu was their watchman, that strong man who had no rival.	jan pi lawa mani li lape la jan Enkitu li lape ala. ona li kama jo e ilo utala li utala e soweli ike. jan pi lawa mani li ken lape pona.
	
	jan mije olin
	
He was merry living with the shepherds, till one day lifting his eyes he saw a man approaching.	jan Enkitu li tawa e oko li lukin e ni: jan mije li tawa noka.
He said to the harlot,	jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘Woman, fetch that man here.	“jan Sanka o, mi wile e ni: jan ni li tawa weka.
Why has he come? I wish to know his name.’	tan seme la ona li tawa?”
She went and called the man saying,	jan Sanka li toki e ni:
‘Sir, where are you going on this weary journey?’	“jan ante o, sina tawa tan seme? sina sama lukin jan pi pilin ike. sina pilin ike tan seme?”
	
The man answered, saying to Enkidu,	jan mije li toki tawa jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘Gilgamesh has gone into the marriage-house and shut out the people.	“tenpo lili kama la mi en meli olin mi li wan.
He does strange things in Uruk, the city of great streets. At the roll of the drum work begins for the men, and work for the women.	
Gilgamesh the king is about to celebrate marriage with the Queen of Love, and he still demands to be first with the bride,	taso jan Kikamesi li jan lawa. a! ona li wile unpa e olin mi. tenpo pimeja pi kama wan la jan Kikamesi li unpa e olin mi.
the king to be first and the husband to follow, for that was ordained by the gods from his birth, from the time the umbilical cord was cut.	nasin pi kulupu pi jan sewi li ni: tenpo pimeja pi kama wan la jan lawa li ken unpa e meli pi jan ante.”
But now the drums roll for the choice of the bride and the city groans.’	
At these words Enkidu turned white in the face.	jan Enkitu li pilin ike wawa tan toki pi jan ni.
’I will go to the place where Gilgamesh lords it over the people, I will challenge him boldly, and I will cry aloud in Uruk, “I have come to change the old order, for I am the strongest here.”	ona li toki e ni: “mi tawa ma tomo Uluku! jan Kikamesi li unpa ala e meli sina.”
	
	jan Enkitu en jan Sanka li tawa ma tomo Uluku.
	
	utala
	
Now Enkidu strode in front	jan Enkitu li tawa lon nasin pi ma tomo Uluku.
and the woman followed behind.	jan Sanka li tawa lon monsi ona.
He entered Uruk, that great market,	jan Enkitu li lon supa pi ma tomo.
and all the folk thronged round him where he stood in the street in strong-walled Uruk. The people jostled; speaking of him they said,	jan mute li kulupu lon poka ona li toki e ni:
‘He is the spit of Gilgamesh.’ ‘He is shorter.’ ‘He is bigger of bone.’	
‘This is the one who was reared on the milk of wild beasts.	“jan ni li kama tan ma nena.
His is the greatest strength.’	ona li wawa.
The men rejoiced:	
‘Now Gilgamesh has met his match. This great-one, this hero whose beauty is like a god, he is a match even for Gilgamesh.’	ona li suli sama jan Kikamesi.”
	
In Uruk the bridal bed was made, fit for the goddess of love. The bride waited for the bridegroom, but in the night Gilgamesh got up and came to the house. Then Enkidu stepped out, he stood in the street and blocked the way.	jan Enkitu li kama tawa tomo pi jan olin. ona li awen lon sinpin pi lupa pi tomo ni. ona li awen e noka ona lon sinpin pi tomo ni.
	
Mighty Gilgamesh came on	jan Kikamesi li kama.
and Enkidu met him at the gate. He put out his foot and prevented Gilgamesh from entering the house,	taso ona li ken ala kama tawa insa tomo.
so they grappled, holding each other like bulls.	ona li pilin ike wawa. jan Kikamesi li kama utala e jan Enkitu. jan Enkitu li utala e jan Kikamesi. ona tu li utala.
They broke the doorposts and the walls shook, they snorted like bulls locked together. They shattered the doorposts and the walls shook. Gilgamesh bent his knee with his foot planted on the ground and with a turn Enkidu was thrown.	poka pi lupa tomo li tawa! ona li utala wawa. poka pi lupa tomo li pakala! ona li utala sama soweli wawa. sinpin tomo li tawa!
	
	jan sama tu
	
Then immediately his fury died.	jan Kikamesi li pini e ike utala wawa ona li pini utala.
When Enkidu was thrown he said to Gilgamesh,	jan Enkitu li toki tawa ona li toki e ni:
‘There is not another like you in the world.	“jan Kikamesi o! jan ala li sama sina.
Ninsun, who is as strong as a wild ox in the byre, she was the mother who bore you, and now you are raised above all men,	sina wawa sama sewi. mama sewi sina li kama e ni: sina wawa.
and Enlil has given you the kingship, for your strength surpasses the strength of men.	sewi Enli li kama e ni: sina jan lawa.
Such is your destiny, everlasting life is not your destiny. Because of this do not be sad at heart, do not be grieved or oppressed. He has given you power to bind and to loose, to be the darkness and the light of mankind. He has given you unexampled supremacy over the people, victory in battle from which no fugitive returns, in forays and assaults from which there is no going back.	
But do not abuse this power, deal justly with your servants in the palace, deal justly before Shamash.’	jan Kikamesi o pini pali e ike tawa jan pi ma tomo Uluku. ona li jan ike ala tawa sina. sina jan lawa pi jan ni.”
	jan Kikamesi li toki e ni: “toki sina li sona li pona. sina suli li wawa. sina taso li ken toki e ni: sina suli sama mi. jan ante ala li ken toki e ni. o kama jan sama mi!”
	jan Enkitu li toki tawa jan Kikamesi li toki e ni: “sina jan sama mi kin!”
So Enkidu and Gilgamesh embraced and their friendship was sealed.	jan Enkitu li uta e jan Kikamesi. jan Kikamesi li uta e jan Enkitu. ona tu li kama jan sama kin.
