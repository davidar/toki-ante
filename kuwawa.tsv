2 THE FOREST JOURNEY	utala pi jan Kuwawa
	
	wile wawa
	
The eyes of Enkidu were full of tears and his heart was sick. He sighed bitterly	jan Enkitu li toki ala. ona li pilin ike li pana e telo oko.
and Gilgamesh met his eye and said,	jan Kikamesi li lukin e ona li toki e ni:
‘My friend, why do you sigh so bitterly?’	“jan sama o, sina pilin ike tan seme?”
But Enkidu opened his mouth and said,	jan Enkitu li open e uta ona li toki e ni:
‘I am weak, my arms have lost their strength, the cry of sorrow sticks in my throat, I am oppressed by idleness.’	“luka mi li kama wawa ala. wawa mi li kama lili.”
It was then that the lord Gilgamesh turned his thoughts to the Country of the Living; on the Land of Cedars the lord Gilgamesh reflected.	
He said to his servant Enkidu,	jan Kikamesi li toki tawa ona li toki e ni:
’I have not established my name stamped on bricks as my destiny decreed;	
therefore I will go to the country where the cedar is felled.	“o tawa! mi tu o tawa nena pi kasi suli. nena ni li weka tan ni. ona li lon tawa nasin pi anpa suno. kasi suli mute li lon ma ni. palisa pi kasi ni li sewi li kiwen. kasi suli sama li lon ala ma mi.
I will set up my name in the place where the names of famous men are written, and where no man’s name is written yet I will raise a monument to the gods.	
Because of the evil that is in the land, we will go to the forest and destroy the evil; for in the forest lives Humbaba whose name is “Hugeness”, a ferocious giant.	taso jan Kuwawa li lon nena pi kasi suli. jan li kama tawa kasi suli ni li wile pakala e ona li wile kama jo e ona la jan Kuwawa li utala e ona li moli e ona. jan Kuwawa li ike li wawa mute. mi wile e ni: jan ike li lon ala ma. o tawa sewi nena! sina en mi li utala e ona, li anpa e ona, li moli e ona!”
	
	wile pi nimi suli
	
But Enkidu sighed bitterly and said,	jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘When I went with the wild beasts ranging through the wilderness I discovered the forest; its length is ten thousand leagues in every direction.	
Enlil has appointed Humbaba to guard it and armed him with sevenfold terrors, terrible to all flesh is Humbaba.	“jan sama o, jan sewi li wile e ni: jan Kuwawa li lon ma kasi ni. jan sewi Enli li wile e ni: jan Kuwawa li moli e jan.
He guards the cedars so well that when the wild heifer stirs in the forest,	soweli li tawa lon ma kasi la
though she is sixty leagues distant, he hears her.	jan Kuwawa li ken kute e kalama lili weka.
What man would willingly walk into that country and explore its depths?	jan seme li ken kama tawa ma kasi ni?
When he roars it is like the torrent of the storm,	kalama uta pi jan Kuwawa li sama kalama pi telo suli wawa.
his breath is like fire, and his jaws are death itself.	uta ona li sama seli. kon pi uta ona li sama moli.
I tell you, weakness overpowers whoever goes near it: it is not an equal struggle when one fights with Humbaba; he is a great warrior, a battering-ram. Gilgamesh, the watchman of the forest never sleeps.’	sina wile utala e jan ni tan seme? mi tu li wawa sama ala jan ni. mi ken ala anpa e ona.”
	
Gilgamesh replied:	jan Kikamesi li toki tawa jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘Where is the man who can clamber to heaven?	“jan pona mi o, jan seme li ken tawa sewi kon sewi?
Only the gods live for ever with glorious Shamash,	jan sewi taso li moli ala.
but as for us men, our days are numbered,	tenpo suno mute pi jan ma li kama pini. jan li moli.
our occupations are a breath of wind.	jan li pali e ijo. taso ijo ali ni li sama kon.
How is this, already you are afraid!	tenpo ni la sina pilin ike tan ni: sina ken moli. wawa sina li lon seme?
I will go first although I am your lord,	pona. mi lawa e sina.
and you may safely call out,	tenpo pi tawa mi li kama la sina toki e ni tawa mi:
“Forward, there is nothing to fear!”	‘o tawa, o pilin ike ala!’
Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that endures;	jan ike ni li anpa e mi li moli e mi la
men will say of me,	jan mute li toki e ni:
“Gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious Humbaba.”	‘jan Kikamesi li utala e jan wawa Kuwawa li kama anpa li kama moli.’
Long after the child has been bony in my house, they will say it,	tenpo kama la jan lili mi li toki e ni: ‘jan Kikamesi li utala e jan wawa Kuwawa.’ tenpo mute kama la jan li toki e ni: ‘jan Kikamesi li utala e jan wawa Kuwawa lon nena pi kasi suli li kama moli lon utala ni.’
and remember.’	nimi mi li kama suli.”
	
	jan sewi Utu
	
Enkidu spoke again to Gilgamesh, ‘O my lord, if you will enter that country, go first to the hero Shamash, tell the Sun God, for the land is his. The country where the cedar is cut belongs to Shamash.’	jan Kikamesi li tawa tomo pi jan sewi Utu.
	
Gilgamesh took up a kid, white without spot, and a brown one with it; he held them against his breast, and he carried them into the presence of the sun.	ona li moli e soweli lili li sewi e luka ona.
He took in his hand his silver sceptre and he said to glorious Shamash,	ona li toki e ni:
‘O Shamash, hear me, hear me, Shamash, let my voice be heard.	“jan sewi Utu o!
I am going to that country, O Shamash, I am going.	mi wile kama tawa jan Kuwawa li utala e ona.
Here in the city man dies oppressed at heart, man perishes with despair in his heart. I have looked over the wall and I see the bodies floating on the river, and that will be my lot also. Indeed I know it is so, for whoever is tallest among men cannot reach the heavens, and the greatest cannot encompass the earth. Therefore I would enter that country: because I have not established my name stamped on brick as my destiny decreed, I will go to the country where the cedar is cut. I will set up my name where the names of famous men are written; and where no man’s name is written I will raise a monument to the gods.	mi wile e ni: nimi mi li kama suli.
My hands supplicate, so let it be well with my soul and bring me back to the quay of Uruk. Grant, I beseech, your protection, and let the omen be good.’	sina sona li pona. o pana e pona tawa mi! o kama e ni: mi anpa e jan wawa ni li jo e sijelo pona li tawa ma tomo Uluku”.
	taso jan sewi li toki ala.
The tears ran down his face	jan Kikamesi li pana e telo oko.
and he said, ‘Alas, it is a long journey that I must take to the Land of Humbaba. If this enterprise is not to be accomplished, why did you move me, Shamash, with the restless desire to perform it? How can I succeed if you will not succour me? If I die in that country I will die without rancour, but if I return I will make a glorious offering of gifts and of praise to Shamash.’	ona li toki e ni: “jan sewi Utu o! mi moli e jan Kuwawa la mi toki mute e pona sina li pali e sitelen sina kiwen.”
	
So Shamash accepted the sacrifice of his tears;	telo oko pi jan Kikamesi li pona tawa jan sewi Utu.
like the compassionate man he showed him mercy.	ona li toki tawa jan Kikamesi li toki e ni: “jan Kikamesi o pilin pona.
He appointed strong allies for Gilgamesh, sons of one mother. The great winds he appointed:	mi lawa e kon tawa.
the scorching wind,	mi jo e kon tawa seli.
the icy wind,	mi jo e kon tawa lete.
the tempest,	mi jo e kon tawa telo.
the north wind,	mi jo e kon tawa pi ko kiwen lili.
the stone [wind],	mi jo e kon tawa tan ma lete.
and the whirlwind.	mi jo e kon tawa tan ma seli.
Like vipers, like dragons, like a scorching fire, like a serpent that freezes the heart, a destroying flood and the lightning’s fork, such were they and Gilgamesh rejoiced.	o tawa nena pi kasi suli! o utala e ike.”
[He] stationed [these winds] in the mountain caves.	jan sewi Utu li kulupu e kon tawa mute lon insa lupa pi nena kiwen.
	
	kulupu pi jan sona
	
He went to the forge and said, ‘I will give orders to the armourers; they shall cast us our weapons while we watch them.’ So they gave orders to the armourers and the craftsmen sat down in conference.	jan Kikamesi en jan Enkitu li tawa jan pali pi ilo utala.
They went into the groves of the plain and cut willow and box-wood; they cast for them axes of nine score pounds,	ona li pali e ilo suli pi kasi suli
and great swords they cast with blades of six score pounds each one, with pommels and hilts of thirty pounds.	e ilo palisa utala suli
They cast for Gilgamesh the axe ‘Might of Heroes’ and the bow of Anshan; and Gilgamesh was armed and Enkidu; and the weight of the arms they carried was thirty score pounds.	li pana e ilo ni tawa ona.
	
The people collected and the counsellors in the streets and in the market-place of Uruk;	jan Kikamesi en jan Enkitu li tawa supa pi ma tomo.
they came through the gate of seven bolts and Gilgamesh spoke to them in the market-place:	jan lawa Kikamesi li toki e ni:
’I, Gilgamesh, go to see that creature of whom such things are spoken, the rumour of whose name fills the world.	“jan ali o kute! mi wile kama tawa jan wawa Kuwawa li moli e ona.
	jan li jo ala e mama li jo ala e meli la mi wile e ni: jan ni tawa poka mi.”
	jan mute li kulupu poka ona.
	
	jan Kikamesi li kama tawa kulupu pi jan sona pi ma tomo Uluku li toki e ni:
I will conquer him in his cedar wood and show the strength of the sons of Uruk, all the world shall know of it. I am committed to this enterprise: to climb the mountain, to cut down the cedar, and leave behind me an enduring name.’	“mi wile kama tawa jan Kuwawa li utala e ona li moli e ona. nimi mi li kama suli. nimi pi jan tan ma tomo Uluku li kama suli.”
The counsellors of Uruk; the great market, answered him,	jan sona li toki tawa jan Kikamesi li toki e ni:
’Gilgamesh, you are young, your courage carries you too far, you cannot know what this enterprise means which you plan.	“jan lawa o! sina wile utala e jan ike ni tan seme? pilin sina li suli li wawa sama pilin pi jan lili. taso sona sina li suli ala.
We have heard that Hurnbaba is not like men who die, his weapons are such that none can stand against them; the forest stretches for ten thousand leagues in every direction; who would willingly go down to explore its depths?	jan Kuwawa li ike lukin li wawa mute.
As for Humbaba, when he roars it is like the torrent of the storm,	kalama uta pi jan Kuwawa li sama kalama pi telo suli wawa.
his breath is like fire and his jaws are death itself.	uta ona li sama seli. kon pi uta ona li sama moli.
Why do you crave to do this thing, Gilgamesh? It is no equal struggle when one fights with Humbaba, that battering-ram.	sina ken ala anpa e ona. wile sina li pona ala.”
	
When he heard these words of the counsellors Gilgamesh looked at his friend and laughed,	jan Kikamesi li toki tawa jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘How shall I answer them; shall I say I am afraid of Humbaba, I will sit at home all the rest of my days?’	“jan pona mi o! jan ni li toki e nimi Kuwawa taso la ona li pilin ike kin.”
	
	ona li toki e ni: “jan sona pi ma tomo Uluku o! mi jan lawa. jan Enkitu li tawa poka mi. ona li kama tan ma nena li suli li wawa. mi tu li ken anpa e jan wawa Kuwawa lon nena pi kasi suli.”
	
	jan sewi Nintu
	
Then Gilgamesh opened his mouth again and said to Enkidu,	jan Kikamesi li toki tawa jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘My friend, let us go to the Great Palace, to Egalmah, and stand before Ninsun the queen. Ninsun is wise with deep knowledge, she will give us counsel for the road we must go.’	“jan pona o kama poka mi. o tawa tomo suli pi mama sewi mi.”
They took each other by the hand as they went to Egalmah, and they went to Ninsun the great queen.	jan Kikamesi li lawa e jan Enkitu tawa tomo pi jan sewi Nintu.
Gilgamesh approached, he entered the palace and spoke to Ninsun.	ona li kama lon insa tomo li toki e ni:
‘Ninsun, will you listen to me; I have a long journey to go, to the Land of Humbaba, I must travel an unknown road and fight a strange battle. From the day I go until I return, till I reach the cedar forest and destroy the evil which Shamash abhors,	“mama o, mi wile kama tawa jan Kuwawa ike li moli e ona.
pray for me to Shamash.’	o toki pona e mi tawa jan sewi Utu!”
	
Ninsun went into her room, she put on a dress becoming to her body,	jan sewi Nintu li telo e sijelo ona li len e len pona lukin.
she put on jewels to make her breast beautiful,	ona li pana e linja sike tawa anpa lawa ona.
she placed a tiara on her head and her skirts swept the ground.	
Then she went up to the altar of the Sun, standing upon the roof of the palace; she burnt incense and lifted her arms to Shamash as the smoke ascended:	jan Nintu li tawa tomo sewi pi jan sewi Utu li sewi e luka li toki e ni:
‘O Shamash, why did you give this restless heart to Gilgamesh, my son; why did you give it? You have moved him and now he sets out on a long journey to the Land of Humbaba, to travel an unknown road and fight a strange battle.	“jan sewi Utu o! sina li pilin ike tawa ike ali. jan lili mi li wile anpa e ike. jan Kikamesi li wile anpa e jan wawa Kuwawa.
Therefore from the day that he goes till the day he returns, until he reaches the cedar forest, until he kills Humbaba and destroys the evil thing which you, Shamash, abhor, do not forget him; but let the dawn, Aya, your dear bride, remind you always, and when day is done give him to the watchman of the night to keep him from harm.’	o pana e pona tawa jan lili mi.”
Then Ninsun the mother of Gilgamesh extinguished the incense, and she called to Enkidu with this exhortation:	jan sewi Nintu li toki tawa jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
’Strong Enkidu, you are not the child of my body, but I will receive you as my adopted son; you are my other child like the foundlings they bring to the temple.	“sina jan pona pi jan Kikamesi. sina jan sama pi jan lili mi. jan Enkitu o, sina jan lili mi.”
	ona li toki e nimi ni:
Serve Gilgamesh as a foundling serves the temple and the priestess who reared him.	“jan lili mi o tawa poka jan Kikamesi! o pana e pona tawa ona. o utala e ike ali poka ona.”
In the presence of my women, any votaries and hierophants, I declare it.’	
Then she placed the amulet for a pledge round his neck, and she said to him, ‘I entrust my son to you; bring him back to me safely.’	jan sewi Nintu li toki e nimi pona wawa li pana e linja sike pi anpa lawa tawa jan Enkitu.
	
	nasin tawa pi ma pi kasi suli
	
And now they brought to them the weapons, they put in their hands the great swords in their golden scabbards, and the bow and the quiver. Gilgamesh took the axe, he slung the quiver from his shoulder, and the bow of Anshan, and buckled the sword to his belt; and so they were armed and ready for the journey.	ona li kama tawa. jan Kikamesi li lawa. ona li jo e ilo suli pi kasi suli e ilo utala palisa suli. jan Enkitu li tawa lon monsi pi jan Kikamesi. ona kin li jo e ilo pi kasi suli e ilo utala palisa.
Now all the people came and pressed on them	kulupu pi jan mute li tawa lon monsi jan Enkitu li jo e ilo pi kasi suli.
and said, ‘When will you return to the city?’	
The counsellors blessed Gilgamesh and warned him, ‘Do not trust too much in your own strength, be watchful, restrain your blows at first. The one who goes in front protects his companion; the good guide who knows the way guards his friend. Let Enkidu lead the way, he knows the road to the forest, he has seen Humbaba and is experienced in battles; let him press first into the passes, let him be watchful and look to himself. Let Enkidu protect his friend, and guard his companion, and bring him safe through the pitfalls of the road. We, the counsellors of Uruk entrust our king to you, O Enkidu; bring him back safely to us.’ Again to Gilgamesh, they said, ‘May Shamash give you your heart’s desire, may he let you see with your eyes the thing accomplished which your lips have spoken; may he open a path for you where it is blocked, and a road for your feet to tread. May he open the mountains for your crossing, and may the nighttime bring you the blessings of night, and Lugulbanda, your guardian god, stand beside you for victory. May you have victory in the battle as though you fought with a child. Wash your feet in the river of Humbaba to which you are journeying; in the evening dig a well, and let there always be pure water in your water-skin. Offer cold water to Shamash and do not forget Lugulbanda.’	jan sona li toki tawa jan Kikamesi li toki e ni: “o tawa! jan sewi sina li pana e pona tawa sina!”
	
Then Enkidu opened his mouth and said, ‘Forward, there is nothing to fear. Follow me, for I know the place where Humbaba lives and the paths where he walks. Let the counsellors go back. Here is no cause for fear.’ When the counsellors heard this they sped the hero on his way. ‘Go, Gilgamesh, may your guardian god protect you on the road and bring you safely back to the quay of Uruk.’	ona li tawa nasin tawa pi nena pi kasi suli.
	
After twenty leagues they broke their fast; after another thirty leagues they stopped for the night.	tenpo suno la ona li tawa. ona li tawa weka mute tan ma tomo Uluku.
	
In the evenings [they] dug a well and offered cold water to Shamash.	tenpo pimeja li kama la ona li pali e lupa pi telo pona. tenpo suno sin la ona li weka e telo pona lili tawa jan sewi Utu. jan sewi li lukin e ona li pilin pona. tenpo suno sin la ona li tawa nasin pi nena pi kasi suli li tawa weka mute mute tan ma tomo. tenpo pimeja sin la ona li pali e lupa pi telo pona li weka e telo pona lili tawa jan sewi.
	
	ma pi kasi suli
	
Fifty leagues they walked in one day; in three days they had walked as much as a journey of a month and two weeks. They crossed seven mountains before they came to the gate of the forest.	tenpo suno li kama. ona li tawa sewi nena li kama tawa poka pi ma pi kasi suli.
Then Enkidu called out to Gilgamesh, ‘Do not go down into the forest; when I opened the gate my hand lost its strength.’	
Gilgamesh answered him, ‘Dear friend, do not speak like a coward. Have we got the better of so many dangers and travelled so far, to turn back at last? You, who are tried in wars and battles, hold dose to me now and you will feel no fear of death; keep beside me and your weakness will pass, the trembling will leave your hand. Would my friend rather stay behind? No, we will go down together into the heart of the forest. Let your courage be roused by the battle to come; forget death and follow me, a man resolute in action, but one who is not foolhardy. When two go together each will protect himself and shield his companion, and if they fall they leave an enduring name.’	
	
Together they went down into the forest and they came to the green mountain. There they stood still, they were struck dumb;	ona li awen li toki ala.
they stood still and gazed at the forest.	ona lukin taso e kasi suli mute.
They saw the height of the cedar,	ona li lukin e ni: kasi suli li sewi mute.
they saw the way into the forest and the track where Humbaba was used to walk. The way was broad and the going was good.	nasin pona li lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli. tenpo mute la jan Kuwawa li tawa lon nasin ni. noka ona li pali e nasin ni.
They gazed at the mountain of cedars, the dwelling-place of the gods and the throne of Ishtar. The hugeness of the cedar rose in front of the mountain, its shade was beautiful, full of comfort; mountain and glade were green with brushwood.	seli suno li ken ala kama tawa insa pi ma kasi tan ni: kasi ni li suli mute. pimeja ni li lete li pona.
	
	lape pi jan Kikamesi
	
There Gilgamesh dug a well before the setting sun. He went up the mountain and poured out fine meal on the ground and said,	ona li tawa nena suli loje walo. jan Kikamesi li weka e ko pan pona tawa ma li toki e ni:
‘O mountain, dwelling of the gods, bring me a favourable dream.’	“nena o pana e lape pona tawa mi!”
Then they took each other by the hand and lay down to sleep; and sleep that flows from the night lapped over them.	tenpo pimeja li kama. jan Kikamesi en jan Enkitu li anpa. ona tu li pilin e luka pi jan sama li lape.
Gilgamesh dreamed, and at midnight sleep left him, and he told his dream to his friend.	jan Kikamesi li pini wawa e lape ona li toki e ni:
‘Enkidu, what was it that woke me if you did not?	“jan Enkitu o, sina toki ala toki tawa mi? sina pilin ala pilin e mi? lape mi li pini tan seme?
My friend, I have dreamed a dream. Get up, look at the mountain precipice. The sleep that the gods sent me is broken. Ah, my friend, what a dream I have had!	mi lape li lukin e ni:
Terror and confusion; I seized hold of a wild bull in the wilderness.	mi utala e soweli wawa.
It bellowed and beat up the dust	ona li tawa wawa e noka ona li tawa e ko kiwen.
till the whole sky was dark,	tan ni la kon li pimeja.
my arm was seized and my tongue bitten.	luka mi li wawa ala.
I fell back on my knee;	mi ken ala anpa e ona.
then someone refreshed me with water from his water-skin.’	jan ante li tawa mi li pana e telo tawa mi. ona li pona.”
	
Enkidu said,	jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘Dear friend, the god to whom we are travelling is no wild bull, though his form is mysterious. That wild bull which you saw is Shamash the Protector;	“jan pona mi o, lukin lape sina li pona. jan Kuwawa li nasa lukin li wawa lukin. taso ona li sama ala soweli wawa ni. soweli wawa pi lape sina li jan sewi Utu.
in our moment of peril he will take our hands.	tenpo utala la ona li pana e pona tawa mi tu.
The one who gave water from his water-skin, that is your own god who cares for your good name, your Lugulbanda. United with him, together we will accomplish a work the fame of which will never die.’	mama sina kin li pana e telo tawa sina. ona li jan lawa Lukapanta.”
	
Gilgamesh said, ‘I dreamed again. We stood in a deep gorge of the mountain, and beside it we two were like the smallest of swamp flies; and suddenly the mountain fell, it struck me and caught my feet from under me. Then came an intolerable light blazing out, and in it was one whose grace and whose beauty were greater than the beauty of this world. He pulled me out from under the mountain, he gave me water to drink and my heart was comforted, and he set my feet on the-ground.’	
	
Then Enkidu the child of the plains said, ‘Let us go down from the mountain and talk this thing over together.’ He said to Gilgamesh the young god, ‘Your dream is good, your dream is excellent, the mountain which you saw is Humbaba. Now, surely, we will seize and kill him, and throw his body down as the mountain fell on the plain.’	
	
The next day after twenty leagues they broke their fast, and after another thirty they stopped for the night. They dug a well before the sun had set and Gilgamesh ascended the mountain. He poured out fine meal on the ground and said, ‘O mountain, dwelling of the gods, send a dream for Enkidu, make him a favourable dream.’ The mountain fashioned a dream for Enkidu; it came, an ominous dream; a cold shower passed over him, it caused him to cower tike the mountain barley under a storm of rain. But Gilgamesh sat with his chin on his knees till the sleep which flows over all mankind lapped over him. Then, at midnight, sleep left him; he got up and said to his friend, ‘Did you call me, or why did I wake? Did you touch me, or why am I terrified? Did not some god pass by, for my limbs are numb with fear? My friend, I saw a third dream and this dream was altogether frightful. The heavens roared and the earth roared again, daylight failed and darkness fell, lightnings flashed, fire blazed out, the clouds lowered, they rained down death. Then the brightness departed, the fire went out, and all was turned to ashes fallen about us. Let us go down from the mountain and talk this over, and consider what we should do.’	
	
	wawa sewi
	
When they had come down from the mountain Gilgamesh seized the axe in his hand: he felled the cedar.	ona li tawa lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli. jan Kikamesi li lukin li toki e ni: “ni li kasi suli pona.” ona li kama jo e ilo li anpa e kasi suli. jan Enkitu li weka e palisa tan kasi suli ni.
When Humbaba heard the noise far off he was enraged;	jan Kuwawa li kute e kalama li pilin ike wawa.
he cried out,	ona li toki wawa e ni:
‘Who is this that has violated my woods and cut down my cedar?’	“jan seme li kama tawa ma mi li pakala e kasi suli mi?”
But glorious Shamash called to them out of heaven, ‘Go forward, do not be afraid.’	
But now Gilgamesh was overcome by weakness, for sleep had seized him suddenly, a profound sleep held him; he lay on the ground, stretched out speechless, as though in a dream.	jan Kuwawa li pana e wawa sewi tawa kalama ni. wawa sewi ni li sama kon li sama suno. ona li tawa sama ilo moli linja. jan Kikamesi li kama anpa li lape.
	jan Enkitu li lape. jan ante tan ma tomo Uluku li lape sama soweli pona lili. jan Enkitu li pini e lape. kalama ala li lon.
When Enkidu touched him	ona li pilin e jan Kikamesi kepeken luka ona.
he did not rise,	jan Kikamesi li tawa ala.
when he spoke to him he did not reply. ‘O Gilgamesh, Lord of the plain of Kullab, the world grows dark, the shadows have spread over it, now is the glimmer of dusk. Shamash has departed, his bright head is quenched in the bosom of his mother Ningal. O Gilgamesh, how long will you lie like this, asleep? Never let the mother who gave you birth be forced in mourning into the city square.’	jan Enkitu li toki wawa e ni: “jan Kikamesi o! jan sama o! tenpo pi suli seme la sina li lape kin?” jan Enkitu li tawa wawa e ona li toki wawa tawa ona.
	
At length Gilgamesh heard him;	jan Kikamesi li open e oko ona li tawa sewi.
he put on his breastplate, ‘The Voice of Heroes’, of thirty shekels’ weight; he put it on as though it had been a light garment that he carried, and it covered him altogether. He straddled the earth like a bull that snuff’s the ground and his teeth were clenched.	
‘By the life of my mother Ninsun who gave me birth, and by the life of my father, divine Lugulbanda, let me live to be the wonder of my mother, as when she nursed me on her lap.	ona li toki e ni: “ike a!
Until we have fought this man, if man he is, this god, if god he is, the way that I took to the Country of the Living will not turn back to the city.’	jan ni li jan ma anu jan sewi?”
	
Then Enkidu, the faithful companion, pleaded, answering him,	jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘O my lord, you do not know this monster and that is the reason you are not afraid. I who know him, I am terrified. His teeth are dragon’s fangs, his countenance is like a lion, his charge is the rushing of the flood, with his look he crushes alike the trees of the forest and reeds in the swamp.	“jan Kuwawa li wawa mute.
O my Lord, you may go on if you choose into thus land, but I will go back to the city. I will tell the lady your mother all your glorious’ deeds till she shouts for joy: and then I will tell the death that followed till she weeps for bitterness.’	jan pona o tawa ala jan ni! mi mute o tawa weka tan ma ni. o tawa ma tomo Uluku.”
But Gilgamesh said,	jan Kikamesi li toki tawa jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘Immolation and sacrifice are not yet for me, the boat of the dead shall not go down, nor the three-ply cloth be cut for my shrouding. Not yet will my people be desolate, nor the pyre be lit in my house and my dwelling burnt on the fire.	“mi wile lukin e jan ni, li utala e ona.
Today, give me your aid and you shall have mine: what then can go amiss with us two? All living creatures born of the flesh shall sit at last in the boat of the West, and when it sinks, when the boat of Magilum sinks, they are gone; but we shall go forward and fix our eyes on this monster. If your heart is fearful throw away fear; if there is terror in it throw away terror. Take your axe in your hand and attack. He who leaves the fight unfinished is not at peace.’	o pilin pona. jan tu li ken ala moli. sina en mi li ken anpa e ona.”

Then Enkidu called out, ‘O Gilgamesh, remember now your boasts in Uruk. Forward, attack, son of Uruk, there is nothing to fear.’ When he heard these words his courage rallied; he answered, ‘Make haste, close in, if the watchman is there do not let him escape to the woods where he will vanish.	jan sewi Utu li toki tawa jan Kikamesi li toki e ni: “o awen ala!
He has put on the first of his seven splendours	jan Kuwawa li len e wawa sewi wan taso.
but not yet the other six,	ona li jo e wawa sewi mute lon tomo ona.
let us trap him before he is armed.’	sina awen la ona li ken len e wawa sewi ali. o tawa!”
Humbaba came out from his strong house of cedar.	ona tu li tawa wawa tomo pi jan Kuwawa. jan Kuwawa li tawa ona.
Like a raging wild bull [Gilgamesh] snuffed the ground; the watchman of the woods turned full of threatenings, he cried out.	jan Kikamesi li toki wawa e ni: “mi jan Kikamesi li jan lawa pi ma tomo Uluku! jan Kuwawa ike o kama moli!” ona li wile utala e jan Kuwawa kepeken ilo utala palisa. jan Enkitu li kama tawa utala kin poka ona. taso ona li ken ala utala e ona.
[Humbaba] nodded his head and shook it, menacing Gilgamesh; and on him he fastened his eye, the eye of death.	jan Kuwawa li tawa wawa weka tan nasin pi ilo utala. kalama uta ona li sama kalama pi telo suli wawa. uta ona li sama seli. ona li utala la ma li pakala. nena suli li tawa. kon li kama pimeja.
Then Gilgamesh called to Shamash and his tears were flowing,	jan Kikamesi li pilin ike li pana e telo oko. ona li toki e ni: “a! ona li wawa mute. mi ken anpa ala e ona.
’O glorious Shamash,	jan sewi Utu o!
I have followed the road you commanded but now if you send no succour how shall I escape?	o pana e pona tawa mi!”
	
	kon tawa mute
	
Glorious Shamash heard his prayer	jan sewi Utu li kute e toki pi jan Kikamesi.
and he summoned the great wind, the north wind, the whirlwind, the storm and the icy wind, the tempest and the scorching wind; they came like dragons, like a scorching fire, like a serpent that freezes the heart, a destroying flood and the lightning’s fork.	ona li weka e kon tawa mute tan insa lupa pi nena kiwen. kon tawa seli li utala e jan Kuwawa. kon tawa lete li utala e ona. kon tawa telo li utala e jan Kuwawa. kon tawa pi ko kiwen lili li utala e ona. kon tawa tan ma lete li utala e jan Kuwawa. kon tawa tan ma seli li utala e ona.
The eight winds rose up against Humbaba, they beat against his eyes;	kon tawa mute li utala e jan Kuwawa.
he was gripped, unable to go forward or back.	ona li ken ala tawa.
	
Gilgamesh shouted, ‘By the life of Ninsun my mother and divine Lugulbanda my father, in the Country of the Living, in this Land I have discovered your dwelling; my weak arms and my small weapons I have brought to this Land against you, and now I will enter your house.’	
	
So he felled the first cedar and they cut the branches and laid them at the foot of the mountain. At the first stroke Humbaba blazed out, but still they advanced. They felled seven cedars and cut and bound the branches and laid them at the foot of the mountain, and seven times Humbaba loosed his glory on them. As the seventh blaze died out they reached his lair.	tenpo ni la jan Kikamesi en jan Enkitu li ken tawa ona li ken utala e ona kepeken ilo utala ona.
He slapped his thigh in scorn. He approached like a noble wild bull roped on the mountain, a warrior whose elbows are bound together. The tears started to his eyes and he was pale,	jan Kuwawa li awen. sinpin pi lawa ona li kama pona lukin. ona li toki e ni:
‘Gilgamesh, let me speak.	“jan Kikamesi o kute e mi! jan lawa wawa o moli ala e mi!
I have never known a mother, no, nor a father who reared me.	mi sona ala e mama mi.
I was born of the mountain, he reared me,	nena suli li mama mi.
and Enlil made me the keeper of this forest.	jan sewi Enli li wile e ni: jan li wile pakala e kasi suli ni la mi utala e ona li moli e ona.
Let me go free, Gilgamesh, and I will be your servant, you shall be my lord; all the trees of the forest that I tended on the mountain shall be yours. I will cut them down and build you a palace.’	o pilin ike ala tawa mi! mi wile e ni: sina jan lawa mi. mi anpa e kasi suli mi li pana e ona mute tawa sina. o moli ala e mi. o weka e mi.”
	
	moli pi jan Kuwawa
	
He took him by the hand and led him to his house, so that the heart of Gilgamesh was moved with compassion.	jan Kikemesi li pini pilin e ike tawa jan Kuwawa.
He swore by the heavenly life, by the earthly life, by the underworld itself:	ona li toki tawa jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘O Enkidu, should not the snared, bird return to its nest and the captive man return to his mother’s arms?’	“jan li kama jo e waso lili la jan li wile weka e ona li wile e ni: ona li tawa mama ona. ni li pona ala pona?”
Enkidu answered,	jan Enkitu li toki e ni:
‘The strongest of men will fall to fate if he has no judgement. Namtar, the evil fate that knows no distinction between men, will devour him.	“o kute ala e jan Kuwawa. ona li ike. o weka ala e ona.
If the snared bird returns to its nest, if the captive man returns to his mother’s arms, then you my friend will never return to the city where the mother is waiting who gave you birth. He will bar the mountain road against you, and make the pathways impassable.’	sina weka e ona la ona li pakala e nasin tawa ma tomo Uluku lon ma ni li utala e mi mute.”
	
Humbaba said,	jan Kuwawa li toki e ni:
‘Enkidu, what you have spoken is evil:	“jan Enkitu o, toki sina li toki ike li toki utala.
you, a hireling, dependent for your bread!	jan lawa sina li pana e moku tawa sina. tan ni taso la sina tawa lon monsi ona.
In envy and for fear of a rival you have spoken evil words.’	tan ni la sina wile ala e ni: jan Kikamesi li jan lawa mi kin. jan anpa o! o toki ala!”
	
Enkidu said, ‘Do not listen, Gilgamesh: this Humbaba must die. Kill Humbaba first and his servants after.’	jan Enkitu li pilin ike wawa.
But Gilgamesh said, ‘If we touch him the blaze and the glory of light will be put out in confusion, the glory and glamour will vanish, its rays will be quenched.’	
Enkidu said to Gilgamesh, ‘Not so, my friend. First entrap the bird, and where shall the chicks run then? Afterwards we can search out the glory and the glamour, when the chicks run distracted through the grass.’	
	
Gilgamesh listened to the word of his companion, he took the axe in his hand, he drew the sword from his belt, and he struck Humbaba with a thrust of the sword to the neck, and Enkidu his comrade struck the second blow.	ona li utala wawa e jan Kuwawa kepeken ilo utala palisa li weka e lawa ona tan sijelo ona.
At the third blow Humbaba fell.	jan Kuwawa li anpa lon ma.
Then there followed confusion for this was the guardian of the forest whom they had felled to the ground. For as far as two leagues the cedars shivered when Enkidu felled the watcher of the forest, he at whose voice Hermon and Lebanon used to tremble. Now the mountains were moved and all the hills, for the guardian of the forest was killed.	kasi suli mute li kalama sama pilin ike.
	
	nimi suli
	
They attacked the cedars, the seven splendours of Humbaba were extinguished. So they pressed on into the forest bearing the sword of eight talents. They uncovered the sacred dwellings of the Anunnaki and while Gilgamesh felled the first of the trees of the forest Enkidu cleared their roots as far as the banks of Euphrates.	jan Kikamesi en jan Enkitu li anpa e kasi suli. jan Uluku li pali poka ona. jan Enkitu li toki e ni: “jan sewi Utu li pona mute. mi wile pali e sinpin suli pi lupa pi tomo ona. kasi suli ni li pona mute tawa pali ni.” ona mute li anpa e kasi suli mute.
	
They set Humbaba before the gods, before Enlil; they kissed the ground and dropped the shroud and set the head before him. When he saw the head of Humbaba, Enlil raged at them.	jan sewi Enli li tawa ma pi kasi suli. ona li lukin li toki tawa ona tu li toki e ni:
’Why did you do this thing?	“sina moli e ona tan seme?!”
	ona li toki ike e ni:
From henceforth may the fire be on your faces,	“seli li pakala e sinpin sina!
may it eat the bread that you eat,	seli li moku e moku sina!
may it drink where you drink.’	seli li moku e telo sina!”
Then Enlil took again the blaze and the seven splendours that had been Humbaba’s: he gave the first to the river, and he gave to the lion, to the stone of execration, to the mountain and to the dreaded daughter of the Queen of Hell.	jan sewi Enli li kama jo e wawa sewi pi jan Kuwawa li tawa weka.
	
[They built a raft and returned home along the Euphrates with the giant tree.]	ona li kama jo e kasi suli mute li tawa tan nena pi kasi suli tawa telo tawa Pulatu. ona li wan e kasi suli mute li pali e supa tawa mute. ona li tawa lon supa ni li tawa e ona lon telo tawa kepeken palisa. nasin ni la ona li tawa lon telo. tenpo suno mute lili pini la ona li tawa ma tomo Uluku.
	
O Gilgamesh, king and conqueror of the dreadful blaze; wild bull who plunders the mountain, who crosses the sea, glory to him, and from the brave the greater glory is Enki’s!	jan mute li kulupu li toki e ni: “o lukin! o pilin pona! ona li jan utala pona kin!” nimi ona li suli.
