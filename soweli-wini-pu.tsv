INTRODUCTION	kama lipu
	
If you happen to have read another book about Christopher Robin, you may remember that he once had a swan (or the swan had Christopher Robin, I don’t know which) and that he used to call this swan Pooh.	sina lukin e sitelen pi lipu ante pi ijo pi jan Kitopa Jopin, la ken la sina sona e ni: tenpo pini la ona li jo e waso walo (anu waso walo li jo e jan Kitopa Jopin, mi sona ala) en ona li pana e nimi “Pu” tawa waso walo ni.
That was a long time ago, and when we said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we didn’t think the swan would want it any more.	tenpo suli li kama lon pini pi ijo ni: mi tu li toki kulupu e “tawa pona” li awen e nimi tan ni: tawa mi tu la waso walo ni li awen ala wile e ona.
Well, when Edward Bear said that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once, without stopping to think, that he was Winnie-the-Pooh.	ni la soweli pi luka wawa Etuwa li toki e ni: ona li wile jo e nimi pi sin nasa, pi ona sama taso. tenpo sama la jan Kitopa Jopin li toki e ni: ona li soweli Wini Pu.
And he was.	a: ona li ona.
So, as I have explained the Pooh part,	pona. mi pana e sona pi soweli Pu.
I will now explain the rest of it.	kama la mi pana e sona pi ale ante.
	
You can’t be in London for long without going to the Zoo.	jan li lon ma tomo Lantan, la tenpo lili la ona li kama wile tawa ma sijelo.
There are some people who begin the Zoo at the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called WAYOUT,	jan pi mute wan li kama insa ona kepeken lupa “TAWAWINSA” li lukin tawa lon tenpo pi lili mute, lon poka pi tomo sijelo ale, tawa lupa pi tomo sijelo “TAWAWEKA”.
but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the most, and stay there.	taso jan pi suwi sin li tawa pona tawa sijelo li awen lon ona li olin mute e ona.
So when Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes to where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something to the third keeper from the left,	sama ni la jan Kitopa Jopin li tawa ma sijelo, la ona li tawa soweli walo pi luka wawa li toki pi kalama lili tawa jan sinpin nanpa mute.
and doors are unlocked,	lupa li kama open.
and we wander through dark passages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage,	mi tu li tawa lon nasin pimeja li tawa sewi lon mute supa, tawa tomo sijelo.
and the cage is opened,	tomo ni li kama open.
and out trots something brown and furry,	tan insa ona la ijo pimeja pi linja mute li kama.
and with a happy cry of “Oh, Bear!” Christopher Robin rushes into its arms.	jan Kitopa Jopin li toki wawa e “soweli pi luka wawa o!” li tawa lon tenpo sama tawa luka ona.
Now this bear’s name is Winnie,	tenpo ni la nimi pi soweli ni pi luka wawa li Wini.
which shows what a good name for bears it is,	ni li pana e sona ni: ona li toki pona tawa soweli pi luka wawa.
but the funny thing is that we can’t remember whether Winnie is called after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie.	taso ni li musi: mi tu li ken ala awen sona e ni: soweli Wini li kama jo e nimi ona tan soweli Pu anu soweli Pu li kama jo e nimi ona tan soweli Wini.
We did know once,	tenpo pini wan la mi tu li sona.
but we have forgotten…	taso mi tu li pini sona…
	
I had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and said in his squeaky voice, “What about Me?”	mi ken sitelen e nimi pi mute ni taso tan ni: soweli lili li lukin e sewi li toki e ni kepeken uta lili: “seme mi li lon?”
“My dear Piglet,” I said, “the whole book is about you.”	mi toki e ni: “soweli pona mi pi palisa monsi sike o, ale lipu li toki e ijo sina.”
“So it is about Pooh,” he squeaked.	ona li toki e ni kepeken uta lili: “ni la ona li toki e ijo pi soweli Pu.”
You see what it is.	
He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is having a Grand Introduction all to himself.	ona li pilin pi lili ike tan ni: nimi pi soweli Pu li ken kama ijo suli tawa jan.
Pooh is the favourite, of course,	ni li sona: soweli Pu li pona mute tawa jan Kitopa Jopin.
there’s no denying it,	jan li ken ala toki e ijo ante.
but Piglet comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses;	taso soweli lili li jo e ijo pona, soweli Pu li jo ala e ona.
because you can’t take Pooh to school without everybody knowing it,	jan li ken ala tawa tomo sona e soweli Pu lon ni ala: jan ale kama sona e ni.
but Piglet is so small that he slips into a pocket,	taso soweli lili li lili ni: ona li ken kama lon poki.
where it is very comforting to feel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or twenty-two.	jan li pilin sona ala e ni, esun tu li luka tu en tu anu luka tu tu, la ona li ken luka e soweli lili li kama sin pilin pona.
Sometimes he slips out and has a good look in the ink-pot,	tenpo pi mute wan la ona li kama weka li lukin pona e poki pi telo sitelen.
and in this way he has got more education than Pooh,	a: ona li kama sona e mute. soweli Pu li kama sona e lili.
but Pooh doesn’t mind.	taso tawa soweli Pu la ni li suli ala.
Some have brains, and some haven’t, he says,	ona li toki e ni: jan wan li jo e lawa, jan ante li jo ala e ona.
and there it is.	a: ni.
	
And now all the others are saying, “What about Us?”	tenpo ni la jan ante ale li toki e ni: “seme pi mi mute li lon?”
So perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writing Introductions and get on with the book.	tan ni la ken la mi wile pini sitelen e kama pi lipu ni li wile kama pali e lipu sama.

IN WHICH WE ARE INTRODUCED TO WINNIE-THE-POOH AND SOME BEES, AND THE STORIES BEGIN	ona la mi mute li kama sona e soweli Wini Pu e pipi kon pi ko suwi en toki li kama
	
Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now,	ni la soweli pi luka wawa Etuwa li tawa anpa kepeken mute supa.
bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin.	monsi lawa ona li kalama “PUN”, “PUN”, “PUN” lon monsi pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,	tawa ona la kepeken nasin ni taso la jan li ken tawa anpa kepeken mute supa.
but sometimes he feels that there really is another way,	taso tenpo pi mute wan la ona li pilin e ni: nasin ante li lon.
if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it.	taso ona li ken ala toki insa e ni tan ni: ona li ken ala pini kalama “PUN”.
	
And then he feels that perhaps there isn’t.	tenpo ante la ona li pilin e ni: nasin ante li lon ala.
Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.	taso tenpo ni la ona li lon anpa en en jan li ken kama sona e nimi ona: Wini Pu.
	
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, “But I thought he was a boy?”	mi kute e nimi ona lon tenpo nanpa wan, la mi sama sina. mi toki e ni: taso tawa mi la ona li mije.
	
“So did I,” said Christopher Robin.	“tawa mi a.” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
	
“Then you can’t call him Winnie?”	“tan ni la sina ken ala pana e nimi ‘Wini’ tawa ona.”
	
“I don’t.”	“ala.”
	
“But you said —”	“taso sina toki e ni —”
	
“He’s Winnie-ther-Pooh.	“ona li soweli Wini Pu.
Don’t you know what ‘ther’ means?”	seme anu sina sona ala e kon pi nimi ‘pu’?”
	
“Ah, yes, now I do,” I said quickly;	“a, sona” li toki lon tenpo lili;
and I hope you do too, because it is all the explanation you are going to get.	sama ni la sina o toki e ni tan ni: sina ken kama jo e toki pona ni taso.
	
Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs,	tenpo pi mute wan la soweli Wini Pu li kama lon anpa kepeken mute supa li wile musi.
and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story.	tenpo ante la ona li wile kalama ala lon sinpin seli li wile kute e toki.
This evening —	tenpo pimeja kama ni la —
	
“What about a story?” said Christopher Robin.	“seme toki li lon?” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
	
“What about a story?” I said.	“seme toki li lon?” li toki mi.
	
“Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?”	“o pona o toki e wan tawa soweli Wini Pu.”
	
“I suppose I could,” I said.	“tawa mi la ken la mi ken” li toki mi.
“What sort of stories does he like?”	“toki seme li pona tawa ona?”
	
“About himself.	“toki pi ona sama.
Because he’s that sort of Bear.”	ona li soweli ni pi luka wawa.”
	
“Oh, I see.”	“a, mi sona.”
	
“So could you very sweetly?”	“ni la sina pona anu seme?”
	
“I’ll try,” I said.	“mi lukin ni” li toki mi.
	
So I tried.	ni, mi lukin ni.
	
***	***
	
Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders.	tenpo wan pini pi weka mute, pini pi tenpo esun pini la soweli Wini Pu li lon ma pi kasi suli li wan taso li lon anpa pi nimi “Santa”.
	
(“What does ‘under the name’ mean?” asked Christopher Robin.	(“kon pi nimi ‘lon anpa nimi’ li seme?” li toki pi wile sona pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
“It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it.”	“ni li sama nimi ‘ona li jo e nimi lon sewi pi lupa tomo li lon anpa’.”
	
“Winnie-the-Pooh wasn’t quite sure,” said Christopher Robin.	“soweli Wini Pu li pilin sona ala” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
	
“Now I am,” said a growly voice.	“tenpo ni la mi pilin sona” li toki kepeken uta suli.
	
“Then I will go on,” said I.)	“ni la mi awen pali” li toki mi.)
	
One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle of the forest,	tenpo suno wan la ona li weka li tawa, la ona li kama lon ma taso lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli.
and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree,	insa ona la kasi suli li lon.
and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.	tan lawa pi kasi suli la kalama “SSS” wawa li kama.
	
Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think.	soweli Wini Pu li kama anpa lon noka pi kasi suli li lon luka tu ona e lawa ona li kama toki insa.
	
First of all he said to himself:	tenpo nanpa wan la ona li toki insa e ni:
“That buzzing-noise means something.	“kon pi kalama ‘SSS’ ni li lon.
You don’t get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something.	kalama ‘SSS’ li kama ala tan ala li awen kalama ‘SSS’ taso ala li jo ala e kon ala.
If there’s a buzzing-noise, somebody’s making a buzzing-noise,	kalama ‘SSS’ li lon, la jan a li kalama ‘SSS’.
and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you’re a bee.”	mi sona e ni: jan li kalama ‘SSS’ tan ni taso: jan ni li pipi kon pi ko suwi.”
	
Then he thought another long time, and said:	tenpo suli sin la ona li toki insa li toki e ni:
“And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey.”	“mi sona e ni: jan li pipi kon pi ko suwi tan ni taso: jan ni li pali e ko suwi.”
	
And then he got up, and said:	ni la ona li kama sinpin li toki e ni:
“And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.”	“mi sona e ni: jan li pali e ko suwi tan ni taso: mi ken moku e ona.”
So he began to climb the tree	ni la ona li kama tawa lawa pi kasi suli kepeken noka en luka.
	
He climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself. It went like this:	ona li tawa sewi li tawa sewi li tawa sewi li kalama musi lili e ni tawa ona sama:
	
Isn’t it funny	ni li nasa anu seme?:
How a bear likes honey?	ko suwi li pona tawa soweli pi luka wawa
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!	SSS! SSS! SSS!
I wonder why he does?	mi wile sona e ni: tan seme la ona li ni?
	
Then he climbed a little further … and a little further … and then just a little further.	ona li tawa lili li tawa lili li tawa lili.
By that time he had thought of another song.	ni la ona li lon e kalama musi sin.
	
It’s a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees,	ni li sitelen insa musi: soweli pi luka wawa li pipi kon pi ko suwi, la
They’d build their nests at the bottom of trees.	ona li lon noka pi kasi suli e tomo ona.
And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),	ni — pipi kon pi ko suwi li soweli pi luka wawa — la
We shouldn’t have to climb up all these stairs.	mi ale li wile ala tawa sewi kepeken mute supa suli ni.
	
He was getting rather tired by this time,	tenpo ni la ona li kama wile lape.
so that is why he sang a Complaining Song.	tan ni la ona li kalama pi pilin ike.
He was nearly there now,	ona li weka pi lili taso tan pini nasin.
and if he just stood on that branch…	ona li ken noka e palisa kasi ni t-a-s-o, la …
	
Crack!	KA!
	
“Oh, help!” said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him.	“o pana e pona!” li toki pi soweli Pu lon tenpo ni: ona li kiwen utala tawa palisa kasi lon anpa.
	
“If only I hadn’t —” he said, as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch.	“mi ike – “ li toki ona lon tenpo ni: ona li kiwen utala tawa palisa kasi ante lon anpa sin.
	
“You see, what I meant to do,” he explained, as he turned head-over-heels,	“o sona e ni: taso mi wile e ni:” li toki ona lon tenpo ni: lawa li kama lon anpa noka.
and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below,	ona li kiwen utala tawa palisa kasi ante lon anpa sin sin.
“what I meant to do —”	“taso mi wile e ni: — “
	
“Of course, it was rather —” he admitted, as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches.	“taso ni li sona: — “ li toki ona lon tenpo ni: tenpo pi lili mute la ona li tawa lon ale poka pi palisa kasi mute tu.
	
“It all comes, I suppose,” he decided, as he said good-bye to the last branch, spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush,	“tawa mi la ale ni li tan ni:” li toki sona ona lon tenpo ni: ona li toki e “tawa pona” tawa palisa kasi pi nanpa pini li tawa sike lon tenpo mute li tawa lon kon, tawa kasi pi palisa utala.
“it all comes of liking honey so much.	“ale li tan ni: tawa jan la ko suwi li pona ni.
Oh, help!”	o pana e pona!”
	
He crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the prickles from his nose, and began to think again.	ona li tawa weka tan kasi pi palisa utala li weka e wan pi palisa utala tan nena pi sinpin lawa ona li kama toki insa lon tenpo sin.
And the first person he thought of was Christopher Robin.	jan nanpa wan pi toki insa ona li jan Kitopa Jopin.
	
(“Was that me?” said Christopher Robin in an awed voice,	(“mi?” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin tan pilin pi sin nasa.
hardly daring to believe it.	tawa ona la ni li ike sona.
	
“That was you.”	“sina.”
	
Christopher Robin said nothing,	jan Kitopa Jopin li toki ala.
but his eyes got larger and larger,	taso lukin ona li kama suli li kama suli sin.
and his face got pinker and pinker.)	sinpin lawa ona li kama loje li kama loje sin.)
	
So Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin,	ni la soweli Wini Pu li tawa jan pona ona Kitopa Jopin.
who lived behind a green door in another part of the Forest.	tomo ona li lon wan ante pi ma pi kasi suli li jo e lupa tomo laso.
	
“Good morning, Christopher Robin,” he said.	“tenpo suno pona, jan Kitopa Jopin o” li toki ona.
	
“Good morning, Winnie-ther-Pooh,” said you.	“tenpo suno pona, soweli Wini Pu o” li toki sina.
	
“I wonder if you’ve got such a thing as a balloon about you?”	“mi wile sona e ni: sina jo e sike kon kule lon poka sike sina anu seme?”
	
“A balloon?”	“sike kon kule?”
	
“Yes,	“sike kon kule.
I just said to myself coming along:	mi tawa ni. mi toki e ni tawa mi sama:
‘I wonder if Christopher Robin has such a thing as a balloon about him?’	‘jan Kitopa Jopin li jo e sike kon kule anu seme?’
I just said it to myself,	mi toki e ni tawa mi sama.
thinking of balloons,	mi toki insa e ijo pi sike kon.
and wondering.”	mi kama wile sona.”
	
“What do you want a balloon for?” you said.	“tan seme la sina wile e sike kon?” li toki sina.
	
Winnie-the-Pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening,	soweli Wini Pu li lukin tawa poka sike ona li lukin e ni: jan ala li kute.
put his paw to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper:	ona li lon uta ona e luka ona li toki kepeken uta suli e ni:
“Honey!”	“ko suwi!”
	
“But you don’t get honey with balloons!”	“taso jan li ken ala alasa e ko suwi kepeken sike kon!”
	
“I do,” said Pooh.	“mi ken” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
Well, it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend Piglet,	a, tenpo suno pini la sina lon kulupu musi lon tomo pi jan pona soweli lili.
and you had balloons at the party.	sina jo e sike kon mute lon kulupu musi ni.
You had had a big green balloon;	sina jo e sike kon suli pi laso kasi,
and one of Rabbit’s relations had had a big blue one,	jan poka pi soweli pi kute suli li jo e wan suli pi laso sewi.
and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a party at all;	ona li awen e sike kon lon ni li tawa weka tan ni: ona li lili ike li ken ala lon kulupu musi a.
and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you.	ni la sina tawa tomo sina e wan pi laso kasi e wan pi laso sewi.
	
“Which one would you like?” you asked Pooh.	“sina wile e ona seme?” li toki sina tawa soweli Pu.
He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.	ona li lon luka ona e lawa ona li toki insa li pilin lon tenpo suli.
	
“It’s like this,” he said.	“ni li lon:” li toki ona.
“When you go after honey with a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees know you’re coming.	“jan li alasa e ko suwi kepeken sike kon, la ni li suli: tawa pipi kon pi ko suwi la jan li pana ala e sona ni: ona li kama.
Now, if you have a green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree,	tan ni la jan li jo e sike kon pi laso kasi, la tawa ona mute la jan li wan pi kasi suli.
and not notice you,	kepeken ni la ona mute li ken ala kama lukin e jan.
and if you have a blue balloon, they might think you were only part of the sky,	jan li jo e sike kon pi laso sewi, la tawa ona mute la jan li wan sewi.
and not notice you,	kepeken ni la ona mute li ken ala kama lukin e jan.
and the question is:	mi wile sona e ni:
Which is most likely?”	seme li ken suli?”
	
“Wouldn’t they notice you underneath the balloon?” you asked.	“seme anu ona li kama lukin e sina lon anpa pi sike kon?” li toki sina.
	
“They might or they might not,” said Winnie-the-Pooh.	“ken anu ken ala” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu.
“You never can tell with bees.”	“tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi pipi kon pi ko suwi.”
He thought for a moment and said:	tenpo lili la ona li toki insa li toki e ni:
“I shall try to look like a small black cloud.	“mi o lukin+sama kon-telo-pimeja-lili lon sewi.
That will deceive them.”	kepeken ni la ona mute li ken ala kama sona.”
	
“Then you had better have the blue balloon,” you said;	ni la sina o jo e sike kon pi laso sewi” li toki sina.
and so it was decided.	ni li kama.
	
Well, you both went out with the blue balloon,	ni la sina tu li tawa weka li jo e sike kon pi laso sewi.
and you took your gun with you, just in case, as you always did,	sina li tawa li jo e ilo alasa tan ken pi ike kama, sina pali ni lon tenpo ale.
and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of,	soweli Wini Pu li tawa ma telo, ona li sona e ona.
and rolled and rolled until he was black all over;	ona li anpa lon supa ona li tawa sike li tawa sike li pini kama e ni: selo ona ale li kama pimeja.
and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big,	pini ni la sike kon li kama suli ale.
and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string,	sina en soweli Pu li awen e linja.
you let go suddenly,	tenpo lili la sina pini awen e ona.
and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed there — level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it.	soweli pi luka wawa Pu li pona lukin li lon kon li tawa sewi li awen lon ni — li lon sewi sama lawa pi kasi suli li lon weka ona.
	
“Hooray!” you shouted.	“pona a!” li toki wawa sina.
	
“Isn’t that fine?” shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you.	“seme anu ni li pona?” li toki wawa pi soweli Wini Pu tawa sina lon anpa.
“What do I look like?”	
	
“You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,” you said.	“sina sama soweli pi luka wawa, ona li awen e sike kon” li toki sina.
	
“Not,” said Pooh anxiously, “— not like a small black cloud in a blue sky?”	soweli Pu li pilin akesi li toki e ni: “seme anu mi sama ala kon telo pimeja lili lon sewi laso?”
	
“Not very much.”	“mute ala.”
	
“Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different.	“a, ken la tawa sewi ni la ni li ante.
And, as I say, you never can tell with bees.”	mi toki a e ni: “tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi pipi kon pi ko suwi.”
	
There was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree,	kon ala li tawa poka pi kasi suli e ona.
so there he stayed.	tan ni la ona li awen lon ni.
He could see the honey, he could smell the honey, but he couldn’t quite reach the honey.	ona li ken lukin e ko suwi li ken pilin e kon ona, taso ona li ken ala luka e ko suwi.
	
After a little while he called down to you.	pini pi tenpo lili la ona li toki wawa tawa sina lon anpa.
	
“Christopher Robin!” he said in a loud whisper.	“jan Kitopa Jopin o!” li toki kon wawa ona.
	
“Hallo!”	“toki!”
	
“I think the bees suspect something!”	“tawa mi la pipi kon pi ko suwi li pilin pi ken pi ike kama.”
	
“What sort of thing?”	“ike seme?”
	
“I don’t know.	“mi sona ala.
But something tells me that they’re suspicious!”	taso tan ijo la tawa mi la ona mute li pilin pi ken pi ike kama.”
	
“Perhaps they think that you’re after their honey?”	“ken la tawa ona mute la sina wile alasa e ko suwi ona?”
	
“It may be that.	“ken.
You never can tell with bees.”	tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi pipi kon pi ko suwi.”
	
There was another little silence,	weka kalama lili sin li lon.
and then he called down to you again.	pini ona la ona li toki wawa tawa sina lon tenpo sin.
	
“Christopher Robin!”	“jan Kitopa Jopin o!”
	
“Yes?”	“a?”
	
“Have you an umbrella in your house?”	“sina jo e len utala tawa telo tan sewi anu seme?”
	
“I think so.”	“tawa mi la jo.”
	
“I wish you would bring it out here,	“mi wile e ni: sina lon ni e ona.
and walk up and down with it,	sina tawa mute lon nasin sama.
and look up at me every now and then,	
and say ‘Tut-tut, it looks like rain.’	sina toki e ni: “mu-mu, tawa mi la telo li kama lon tan sewi.”
I think, if you did that, it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees.”	tawa mi la sina pali ni, la ni li pana e pona ni: mi tu li ken lawa ike e pipi kon pi ko suwi.”
	
Well, you laughed to yourself, “Silly old Bear!”	a, sina a musi tawa sina sama e ni: “soweli nasa pi luka wawa o!”
but you didn’t say it aloud because you were so fond of him,	taso sina toki kalama ala tan ni: tawa sina la ona li pona suli.
and you went home for your umbrella.	tan ni la sina tawa tomo. sina wile e len utala tawa telo tan sewi.
	
“Oh, there you are!” called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got back to the tree.	“a, sina kama lon a!” li toki wawa pi soweli Wini Pu tawa anpa lon tenpo ni: sina kama sin lon kasi suli.
“I was beginning to get anxious.	“mi kama pilin akesi.
I have discovered that the bees are now definitely Suspicious.”	mi kama sona e ni: pipi kon pi ko suwi li kama sona e ken pi kama ike.”
	
“Shall I put my umbrella up?” you said.	“mi o sinpin e len utala tawa telo tan sewi anu seme?” li toki sina.
	
“Yes, but wait a moment.	“sinpin, taso o awen lon tenpo lili.
We must be practical.	mi o kama lukin e pona pali.
The important bee to deceive is the Queen Bee.	pipi kon suli pi ko suwi li pipi lawa taso. mi tu o toki ike e ona.
Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down there?”	sina lon anpa li ken lukin e pipi lawa anu seme?”
	
“No.”	“ala.”
	
“A pity.	“ike.
Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying, ‘Tut-tut, it looks like rain,’	ni la o tawa mute lon nasin sama o toki e ni: “mu-mu, tawa mi la telo li kama lon tan sewi.”
I shall do what I can by singing a little Cloud Song, such as a cloud might sing…	mi ken pali ni taso: mi pana e kalama musi pi kon telo lon sewi sama kon telo lon sewi…
Go!”	o tawa!”
	
So, while you walked up and down	ni la sina tawa mute lon nasin sama.
and wondered if it would rain,	sina toki e ni: sina wile sona e ni: telo tan sewi li kama anu seme.
Winnie-the-Pooh sang this song:	tenpo sama la soweli Wini Pu li kalama musi e ni:
	
How sweet to be a Cloud	ni li suwi: ijo li kon telo lon sewi
Floating in the Blue!	li kon lon laso sewi
Every little cloud	kon telo lili ale lon sewi
Always sings aloud.	li kalama musi e ni:
“How sweet to be a Cloud	ni li suwi: ijo li kon telo lon sewi
Floating in the Blue!”	li kon lon laso sewi!”
It makes him very proud	ona li pilin suli tan ni:
To be a little cloud.	ona li kon telo lili lon sewi.
	
The bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever.	sama tenpo pini ale la pipi kon pi ko suwi li kalama “SSS” ni: ona li pilin pi ken pi ike kama.
Some of them, indeed, left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of this song,	a, wan ona li tawa weka tan tomo ona li tawa lon poka sike pi kon telo lon sewi lon tenpo ni: ona li pana e pini pi kalama musi ni.
and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment, and then got up again.	pipi kon wan pi ko suwi li kama anpa lon nena sinpin pi kon telo lon sewi lon tenpo lili li tawa weka.
	
“Christopher — ow!	“jan Kitopa — a!
— Robin,” called out the cloud.	— Jopin o” li toki wawa pi kon telo lon sewi.
	
“Yes?”	“a?”
	
“I have just been thinking,	“mi pini toki insa.
and I have come to a very important decision.	mi kama sona e ijo pi suli mute.
These are the wrong sort of bees.”	pipi kon ni pi ko suwi li ike.”
	
“Are they?”	“ni?”
	
“Quite the wrong sort.	“ike, a.
So I should think they would make the wrong sort of honey, shouldn’t you?”	tan ni la ni li kama tawa mi: ko suwi ona li ike.”
	
“Would they?”	“ni?”
	
“Yes.	“a.
So I think I shall come down.”	tan ni la mi wile kama sin lon anpa.”
	
“How?” asked you.	“kepeken seme?” li toki sina.
	
Winnie-the-Pooh hadn’t thought about this.	soweli Wini Pu li kama ala sona e ni.
If he let go of the string, he would fall — bump —	ona li weka e luka tan linja, la ona li kiwen utala tawa anpa — PUN.
and he didn’t like the idea of that.	tawa ona la ni li pona ala.
So he thought for a long time, and then he said:	tan ni la ona li toki insa lon tenpo suli li toki e ni:
	
“Christopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun.	“jan Kitopa Jopin o, sina o tan e kiwen utala tawa sike kon, kepeken ilo alasa sina.
Have you got your gun?”	ona li lon sina anu seme?”
	
“Of course I have,” you said.	“ni li sona: lon” li toki sina.
“But if I do that, it will spoil the balloon,” you said.	“taso mi pali ni, la ni li pakala e kon sike” li toki sina.
But if you don’t” said Pooh, “I shall have to let go,	“taso sina pali ni ala, la” — li toki pi soweli Pu — “mi wile weka e luka.
and that would spoil me.”	ni li pakala e mi a.”
	
When he put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very carefully at the balloon, and fired.	kepeken nimi ona ni la sina kama sona li lawa e ilo alasa tawa sike kon, kepeken pilin mute li tan e kiwen utala.
	
“Ow!” said Pooh.	“a!” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
“Did I miss?” you asked.	“mi tawa ijo ante e kiwen utala anu seme?” li toki sina.
	
“You didn’t exactly miss,” said Pooh, “but you missed the balloon.”	“tawa ijo ante ala” — li toki pi soweli Pu — “taso tawa sike kon ala.”
	
“I’m so sorry,” you said,	“mi pilin ike” li toki sina.
and you fired again,	sina tan e kiwen utala lon tenpo sin.
and this time you hit the balloon	tenpo ni la sina tawa sike kon e ona.
and the air came slowly out,	kon li kama weka tan ona lon tenpo suli.
and Winnie-the-Pooh floated down to the ground.	soweli Wini Pu li kama lon anpa.
	
But his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that time	taso luka ona li linja ala tan ni: ona li awen e luka ona lon linja pi sike kon lon tenpo ale.
that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week,	tan ni la luka ona li awen sinpin lon pini pi tenpo suno esun a.
and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off.	pipi kon li kama anpa lon nena sinpin ona, la tenpo ale la ona li wile weka e ona kepeken kon tan uta.
And I think — but I am not sure — that that is why he was always called Pooh.	tawa mi la — taso mi sona ala — tan ni la nimi ona li Pu.

“Is that the end of the story?” asked Christopher Robin.	“ni li pini toki?” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
	
“That’s the end of that one.	“ni li pini pi wan ni.
There are others.”	taso wan ante li lon.”
	
“About Pooh and Me?”	“pi ijo pi soweli Pu en mi anu seme?”
	
“And Piglet and Rabbit and all of you.	“en soweli lili en soweli pi kute suli en sina ale.
Don’t you remember?”	seme anu sina awen ala sona?”
	
“I do remember,	“mi awen sona.
and then when I try to remember, I forget.”	taso mi lukin awen sona, la mi pini sona.”
	
“That day when Pooh and Piglet tried to catch the Heffalump —”	“tenpo suno ni: soweli Pu en soweli lili li wile alasa e soweli pi nena suli.”
	
“They didn’t catch it, did they?”	“ona tu li kama ala alasa e ona anu seme?”
	
“No.”	“ala.”
	
“Pooh couldn’t, because he hasn’t any brain.	“soweli Pu li ken ala tan ni: ona li jo ala e lawa.
Did I catch it?”	mi kama alasa e ona anu seme?”
	
“Well, that comes into the story.”	“ni li wan toki.”
	
Christopher Robin nodded.	jan Kitopa Jopin li a kepeken lawa.
	
“I do remember,” he said, “only Pooh doesn’t very well,	“mi awen sona a” — li toki ona — “taso soweli Pu li awen sona ala.
so that’s why he likes having it told to him again.	tan ni la ona li wile e ni: jan li toki e ona tawa ona, lon tenpo sin,
Because then it’s a real story and not just a remembering.”	tan ni: kepeken ni la ni li toki lon li sona awen taso ala.”
	
“That’s just how I feel,” I said.	“tawa mi la ni” li toki mi.
	
Christopher Robin gave a deep sigh, picked his Bear up by the leg, and walked off to the door, trailing Pooh behind him.	jan Kitopa li a pi pilin ike li tan anpa e soweli ona pi luka wawa kepeken noka ona li tawa weka tawa lupa tomo li tawa e soweli Pu lon anpa, lon monsi ona.
At the door he turned and said, “Coming to see me have my bath?”	lupa tomo la ona li tawa sike li toki e ni: “sina kama anu seme? mi telo e mi.”
“I didn’t hurt him when I shot him, did I?”	“mi tan e kiwen utala tawa ona, la mi pana ala e pilin ike tawa ona anu seme?”
“Not a bit.”	“ala.”
He nodded and went out,	ona li a kepeken lawa li tawa weka.
and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh – bump, bump, bump – going up the stairs behind him.	pini pi tenpo lili la mi kute e ni: monsi ona la soweli Wini Pu li kalama “PUN”, “PUN”, “PUN” li tawa sewi kepeken mute supa.
CHAPTER II:	wan lipu nanpa tu
IN WHICH POOH GOES VISITING AND GETS INTO A TIGHT PLACE	ona la soweli Pu li tawa tomo pi jan ante li kama lon insa pi ijo lili
	
Edward Bear, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for short, was walking through the forest one day, humming proudly to himself.	soweli pi luka wawa Etuwa — jan pona ona li sona e nimi ona “Wini Pu” anu “Pu” taso — li tawa lon ma pi kasi suli lon tenpo suno wan li pilin suli li kalama musi kepeken uta pi open ala, tawa ona sama.
He had made up a little hum that very morning, as he was doing his Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass:	ona li sitelen insa e kalama musi lon kama pi tenpo suno sama, lon tenpo ni: ona li pona e sijelo kepeken tawa, lon sinpin lukin:
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,	“TA-LA-LA, TA-LA-LA.”
as he stretched up as high as he could go,	ona li sinpin e ona sama li suli pi mute ale e ona sama.
and then Tra-la-la, tra-la—oh, help!—la,	pini ni la: “TA-LA-LA, TA-LA — o pana e pona! — LA.”
as he tried to reach his toes.	ona li lukin luka e palisa noka.
After breakfast he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart,	kama pi tenpo suno la ona li moku. pini ni la ona li toki e ni tawa ona sama, lon tenpo mute mute li kama lon insa pi lawa ona e kalama musi.
and now he was humming it right through, properly.	tenpo ni la ona li kalama musi pi pakala ala e ale ona.
It went like this:	ona li sama ni:
	
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,	TA-LA-LA, TA-LA-LA,
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la,	TA-LA-LA, TA-LA-LA,
Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.	LUN-TUN-SITELUN-TUN.
Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,	SITELITE, SITELITE,
Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle,	SITELITE, SITELITE,
Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.	LUN-TUN-TUN-SITELUN.
	
Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily, wondering what everybody else was doing,	ona li kalama musi tawa ona sama li pilin pona li tawa lon nasin li wile sona e ni: jan ale li pali seme?
and what it felt like, being somebody else,	jan li jan ante, la ni li seme tawa pilin?
when suddenly he came to a sandy bank,	tenpo ni la ona li kama lon sinpin pi ko kiwen.
and in the bank was a large hole.	nena ni la lupa li lon.
	
“Aha!” said Pooh.	“a, a!” li nimi pi soweli Pu.
(Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.)	(“LUN-TUN-SITELUN-TUN.”)
“If I know anything about anything, that hole means Rabbit,” he said,	“mi sona e ijo ijo, la kon pi lupa ni li soweli pi kute suli” li toki ona.
“and Rabbit means Company,” he said,	“kon pi soweli pi kute suli li jan poka” li toki ona.
“and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me-Humming and such like.	“kon pi jan poka li moku li kute tawa kalama musi mi li ni.
Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.”	LUN-TUN-SITELELUN-TUN.”
	
So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out:	ni la ona li kama anpa li lon insa lupa e lawa li toki wawa:
	
“Is anybody at home?”	“jan li lon tomo anu seme?”
	
There was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole,	tenpo lili la kalama li kama.
and then silence.	pini ona la kalama ala li lon.
	
“What I said was, ‘Is anybody at home?’” called out Pooh very loudly.	“mi toki e ni: jan li lon tomo anu seme?” li toki pi wawa mute, pi soweli Pu.
	
“No!” said a voice;	“ala!” li toki pi kalama uta.
and then added, “You needn’t shout so loud.	ona li toki sin e ni: “sina wile ala toki pi kalama pi suli ni.
I heard you quite well the first time.”	mi kute pi pona a e sina lon tenpo nanpa wan.”
	
“Bother!” said Pooh.	“ike!” li toki pi soweli Pu.
“Isn’t there anybody here at all?”	“jan ala li lon anu seme?”
	
“Nobody.”	“jan ala.”
	
Winnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole, and thought for a little, and he thought to himself, “There must be somebody there, because somebody must have said ‘Nobody.’”	soweli Wini Pu li tan lupa e lawa li toki insa lon tenpo wan li toki tawa ona sama e ni: “sona li ni: jan li lon tomo tan ni: jan li toki e ni: ‘jan ala.’”
So he put his head back in the hole, and said:	ni la tenpo sin la ona li lon insa lupa e lawa li toki e ni:
“Hallo, Rabbit, isn’t that you?”	“toki, soweli pi kute suli o, seme anu ni li sina?”
	
“No,” said Rabbit, in a different sort of voice this time.	“ala” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli kepeken kalama uta ante, lon tenpo ni.
	
“But isn’t that Rabbit’s voice?”	“taso seme anu ni li kalama uta pi soweli pi kute suli?”
	
“I don’t think so,” said Rabbit.	“tawa mi la ala” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli.
“It isn’t meant to be.”	“ni li wile ala.”
	
“Oh!” said Pooh.	“a” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
He took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put it back, and said:	ona li tan lupa e lawa li toki insa lon tenpo sin li lon sin e ona li toki e ni:
	
“Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?”	“sina ken toki e ni tawa mi anu seme?: soweli pi kute suli li lon seme?”
	
“He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his.”	“ona li tawa tomo pi soweli pi luka wawa Pu, ona li jan pi pona mute tawa ona.”
	
“But this is Me!” said Bear,	“taso ona li mi!” li toki pi soweli pi luka wawa.
very much surprised.	ona li pilin pi sin nasa.
	
“What sort of Me?”	“‘mi’ seme?”
	
“Pooh Bear.”	“soweli pi luka wawa Pu.”
	
“Are you sure?” said Rabbit,	“sina pilin sona anu seme?” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli.
still more surprised.	ona li pilin pi sin pi nasa mute.
	
“Quite, quite sure,” said Pooh.	“mi pilin sona a, a” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
“Oh, well, then, come in.”	“a, ni la o kama lon insa.”
	
So Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole, and at last he got in.	ni la soweli Pu li tawa kepeken noka en luka lon lupa nasin li kama lon insa lon pini pi tenpo suli.
	
“You were quite right,” said Rabbit,	“sina toki pona a” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli.
looking at him all over.	ona li lukin e ale ona.
“It is you.	“ni la sina.
Glad to see you.”	mi pilin pona tan ni.”
	
“Who did you think it was?”	“tawa sina la ni la jan seme?”
	
“Well, I wasn’t sure.	“mi pilin sona ala.
You know how it is in the Forest.	sina sona a e insa pi ma pi kasi suli.
One can’t have anybody coming into one’s house.	jan li ken ala tawa insa tomo e jan mu.
One has to be careful.	
What about a mouthful of something?”	moku li pona anu seme?”
	
Pooh always liked a little something at eleven o’clock in the morning,	tenpo ale la tawa soweli Pu la moku lili lon pini pi kama pi tenpo suno li pona.
and he was very glad to see Rabbit getting out the plates and mugs; and when Rabbit said, “Honey or condensed milk with your bread?”	ona li pilin pi pona mute tan ni: soweli pi kute suli li lon supa e poki li toki e ni: “ko suwi anu ko pi telo mama lon poka pi pan sina?”.
he was so excited that he said, “Both,”	ona li pilin pi nasa wawa ni: ona li toki sin e ni: “tu ale.”
and then, so as not to seem greedy, he added, “But don’t bother about the bread, please.”	ona li wile e ni ala: ona li wile ike. tan ni la ona li toki sin e ni: sina ken awen weka e pan.
And for a long time after that he said nothing…	pini ni la tenpo suli la ona li toki ala…
until at last, humming to himself in a rather sticky voice, he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and said that he must be going on.	pini ona la ona li kalama musi kepeken uta pi open ala, tawa ona sama, kepeken kalama uta ko a li kama sinpin li luka e luka pi soweli pi kute suli kepeken pilin li toki e ni: ona li wile tawa.
	
“Must you?” said Rabbit politely.	“sina wile anu seme?” li toki suwi pi soweli pi kute suli.
	
“Well,” said Pooh, “I could stay a little longer if it—if you—”	“a,” — li toki pi soweli Pu — “mi ken awen lon tenpo sin lon ni…”
and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder.	ona li lukin lukin tawa tomo pi poki moku.
	
“As a matter of fact,” said Rabbit, “I was going out myself directly.”	“ni li lon:” — li toki pi soweli pi kute suli — “mi sama li tawa weka.”
	
“Oh, well, then, I’ll be going on.	“a, ni la mi tawa.
Good-bye.”	mi tawa.”
	
“Well, good-bye, if you’re sure you won’t have any more.”	“a, tawa pona lon ni: sina pilin sona e ni: sina wile ala e ijo sin.”
	
“Is there any more?” asked Pooh quickly.	“ijo sin li lon anu seme?” li toki pi soweli Pu lon tenpo lili.
	
Rabbit took the covers off the dishes, and said, “No, there wasn’t.”	soweli pi kute suli li weka e len tan poki moku li toki e ni: “ala. lon ala.”
	
“I thought not,” said Pooh,	“sama ni la tawa mi la ala” li toki pi soweli Pu.
nodding to himself.	ona li a kepeken lawa tawa ona sama.
“Well, good-bye.	“a, mi tawa.
I must be going on.”	mi wile tawa.”
	
So he started to climb out of the hole.	ni la ona li kama tawa kepeken noka en luka, tawa weka, tan lupa.
He pulled with his front paws, and pushed with his back paws,	ona li lukin tan e ona sama kepeken luka li lukin tawa e ona kepeken noka.
and in a little while his nose was out in the open again…	pini pi tenpo lili la nena sinpin li kama…
and then his ears…	kute li kama…
and then his front paws…	luka li kama…
and then his shoulders…	lawa sinpin li kama.
and then—	ni la —
	
“Oh, help!” said Pooh.	“o pana e pona!” li toki pi soweli Pu.
“I’d better go back.”	“mi wile tawa monsi.”
	
“Oh, bother!” said Pooh.	“a, ike!” li toki pi soweli Pu.
“I shall have to go on.”	“mi wile tawa sinpin.”
	
“I can’t do either!” said Pooh.	“tu ale li ken ala!” li toki pi soweli Pu.
“Oh, help and bother!”	“o pana e pona! a, ike!”
	
Now by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too,	tenpo ni la sama ni la soweli pi kute suli li wile tawa weka.
and finding the front door full,	taso ona li jo e lupa pi open ala.
he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh, and looked at him.	tan ni la ona li tawa weka kepeken lupa pi monsi tomo li tawa lon poka sike tomo, tawa soweli Pu li lukin e ona.
	
“Hallo, are you stuck?” he asked.	“toki! sina lon insa ike anu seme?” li toki ona.
	
“N-no,” said Pooh carelessly.	“a-ala” li toki pi soweli Pu kepeken pilin ala.
“Just resting	“mi lape taso.
and thinking	mi toki insa taso.
and humming to myself.”	mi kalama musi taso kepeken uta pi open ala, tawa mi sama.”
	
“Here, give us a paw.”	“o, o pana e luka.”
	
Pooh Bear stretched out a paw,	soweli pi luka wawa Pu li lukin tawa weka e luka.
and Rabbit pulled and pulled and pulled…	soweli pi kute suli li lukin tan e ona li lukin tan e ona li lukin tan e ona…
	
“Ow!” cried Pooh.	“a!” li toki wawa pi soweli Pu.
“You’re hurting!”	“sina pana e pilin ike.”
	
“The fact is,” said Rabbit,	“ni li lon:” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli.
“you’re stuck.”	“sina lon insa ike.”
	
“It all comes,” said Pooh crossly, “of not having front doors big enough.”	“ale ni li kama” — li toki pi soweli Pu kepeken pilin utala — “tan ni: jan li jo ala e lupa pi sinpin tomo, pi suli pona.”
	
“It all comes,” said Rabbit sternly, “of eating too much.	“ale ni li kama” — li toki kiwen pi soweli pi kute suli — “tan ni: jan li moku ike.
I thought at the time,” said Rabbit, “only I didn’t like to say anything,” said Rabbit, “that one of us was eating too much,” said Rabbit,	tenpo la mi toki insa, taso mi wile ala toki kalama e ni:” — li toki pi soweli pi kute suli — “wan pi mi tu li moku ike” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli.
“and I knew if wasn’t me,” he said.	mi sona e ni: mi pali ala.” li toki ona.
“Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher Robin.”	“ni, ni, mi tawa ni e jan Kitopa Jopin.”
	
Christopher Robin lived at the other end of the Forest,	tomo pi jan Kitopa Jopin li lon poka ante pi ma pi kasi suli.
and when he came back with Rabbit, and saw the front half of Pooh, he said, “Silly old Bear,” in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again.	ona li tawa sin lon poka pi soweli pi kute suli li lukin e wan tu sinpin pi soweli Pu, la ona li toki e ni: “soweli nasa pi luka wawa o” kepeken kalama uta pi suwi ni: jan ale li pilin sin pi kama pona.
	
“I was just beginning to think,” said Bear, sniffing slightly, “that Rabbit might never be able to use his front door again.	“mi kama toki insa e ni:” — li toki pi soweli pi luka wawa kepeken kalama uta pi pilin ike — “soweli pi kute suli li ken kepeken lupa tomo ona lon tenpo kama ala.
And I should hate that,” he said.	ni li ike tawa mi.”
	
“So should I,” said Rabbit.	“tawa mi a” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli.
	
“Use his front door again?” said Christopher Robin.	“kepeken e lupa tomo ona?” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
“Of course he’ll use his front door again.”	“ni li sona: ona li kepeken lupa tomo ona lon tenpo sin.”
	
“Good,” said Rabbit.	“pona” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli.
	
“If we can’t pull you out, Pooh, we might push you back.”	“mi mute li ken ala tan e sina tawa weka, soweli Pu o, ken la mi mute li wile tawa e sina tawa monsi.”
	
Rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully, and pointed out that, when once Pooh was pushed back, he was back,	jan soweli pi kute suli li toki insa li luka kiwen e linja uta li toki e ni: jan li tawa monsi e soweli Pu, la ona li lon ni lon tenpo sin.
and of course nobody was more glad to see Pooh than he was,	sona li ni: ona li pilin pi pona mute tan ni: ona li lon poka pi soweli Pu.
still there it was, some lived in trees and some lived underground, and—	taso jan wan li jo e tomo lon kasi suli, jan ante li jo e tomo lon anpa ma…
	
“You mean I’d never get out?” said Pooh.	“sina toki e ni anu seme?: tenpo ala la mi ken tawa weka?” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
“I mean,” said Rabbit, “that having got so far, it seems a pity to waste it.”	“mi toki e ni: mute li kama. tawa mi la ona li kama weka ike, la ni li pana e pilin ike.”
	
Christopher Robin nodded.	jan Kitopa Jopin li a kepeken lawa.
	
“Then there’s only one thing to be done,” he said.	“ni la ken li wan taso” li toki ona.
“We shall have to wait for you to get thin again.”	“mi mute o awen lon tenpo ni: sina kama suli ala lon tenpo sin.”
	
“How long does getting thin take?” asked Pooh anxiously.	“tenpo ni, jan li kama suli ala, li suli anu seme?” li toki pi soweli Pu, pi pilin akesi.
	
“About a week, I should think.”	“tawa mi la ni li sama tenpo suno esun.”
	
“But I can’t stay here for a week!”	“taso mi ken ala awen lon ni, lon ale pi tenpo suno esun!”
	
“You can stay here all right, silly old Bear.	“sina ken a awen lon ni, soweli nasa pi luka wawa o.
It’s getting you out which is so difficult.”	ni taso li ike pali: sina li kama tan.”
	
“We’ll read to you,” said Rabbit cheerfully.	“mi mute li ken lukin e sitelen tawa sina” li toki pi soweli pi kute suli kepeken pilin pona.
“And I hope it won’t snow,” he added.	“kama pi ken ni taso li pona tawa mi: telo ko kiwen li kama anpa ala” li toki sin ona.
“And I say, old fellow, you’re taking up a good deal of room in my house—	“mi toki e ni, jan pona o: sina lon insa mute pi tomo mi.
do you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse? Because, I mean, there they are—doing nothing—and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them.”	ni li pona tawa sina anu seme?: mi kepeken e noka sina sama ilo kili tan ni: tawa mi la ona li pali ala. jan li ken kili e len lon supa ona, la ni li pana e pona pali.”
	
“A week!” said Pooh gloomily.	“tenpo suno esun a!” li toki pi soweli Pu, pi pilin ike.
“What about meals?”	“ijo moku li seme?”
	
“I’m afraid no meals,” said Christopher Robin,	“mi pilin ike tan ni: moku li lon ala.” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
“because of getting thin quicker.	“ni pona pali e ni: sina ken kama sin suli ala.
But we will read to you.”	taso mi mute li ken lukin e sitelen tawa sina.”
	
Bear began to sigh, and then found he couldn’t because he was so tightly stuck;	soweli pi luka wawa li kama a pi pilin ike li kama lukin e ni: ona li ken ala tan ni: ona li lon insa pi lili ike ni.
and a tear rolled down his eye,	wan telo li kama anpa tan lukin ona.
as he said:	ona li toki e ni:
	
“Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?”	“ni la sina ken lukin e sitelen pi lipu, ona li pana e wawa anu seme?, li pana e pona e pilin pona tawa soweli pi luka wawa lon insa ike?”
	
So for a week Christopher Robin read that sort of book at the North end of Pooh, and Rabbit hung his washing on the South end … and in between Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer.	ni la ale pi tenpo suno esun la jan Kitopa Jopin li lukin e sitelen pi lipu ni lon poka pi suno ala, soweli pi kute suli li kili e len telo lon poka suno.
And at the end of the week Christopher Robin said, “Now!”	pini pi tenpo suno esun la jan Kitopa Jopin li toki e ni: “o!”
	
So he took hold of Pooh’s front paws	ni la ona li kama awen e luka pi soweli Pu.
and Rabbit took hold of Christopher Robin,	sin ni la soweli pi kute suli li kama awen e jan Kitopa Jopin.
and all Rabbit’s friends and relations took hold of Rabbit,	sin la jan pona ale pi soweli pi kute suli en jan sama li kama awen e soweli pi kute suli.
and they all pulled together…	jan ale li lukin tan e soweli Pu…
	
And for a long time Pooh only said “Ow!” …	tenpo suli la soweli Pu li toki e ni taso: “ike!” …
	
And “Oh!” …	e ni: “o!” …
	
And then, all of a sudden, he said “Pop!”	ni la lon tenpo lili la ona li toki e ni: “PO!”
just as if a cork were coming out of a bottle.	ni li sama ilo len, ona li kama tan lupa poki.
	
And Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit’s friends and relations went head-over-heels backwards…	jan Kitopa Jopin en soweli pi kute suli en jan pona ale ona en jan sama ale ona li tawa sike tawa monsi…
and on the top of them came Winnie-the-Pooh—free!	supa ona la soweli Wini Pu li kama — taso!
	
So, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself.	ni la ona li a kepeken lawa tawa jan pona mute li awen sin tawa lon ma pi kasi suli li kalama musi kepeken uta pi open ala, tawa ona sama.
But, Christopher Robin looked after him lovingly, and said to himself, “Silly old Bear!”	taso jan Kitopa Jopin li lukin e monsi tawa ona kepeken pilin olin li toki tawa ona sama e ni: “soweli nasa pi luka wawa o!”
CHAPTER III:	wan lipu nanpa mute
IN WHICH POOH AND PIGLET GO HUNTING AND NEARLY CATCH A WOOZLE	ona la soweli Pu en soweli lili li alasa li alasa pi lili ike e soweli pi kiwen uta wawa
	
The Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beech-tree,	soweli lili li jo e tomo pi suli mute lon insa pi kasi suli.
and the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest,	kasi suli ni li lon insa pi ma pi kasi suli.
and the Piglet lived in the middle of the house.	soweli lili li jo e tomo lon insa pi tomo ni.
Next to his house was a piece of broken board which had:	poka pi tomo ona la lipu suli li lon.
“TRESPASSERS W” on it.	ona li jo e sitelen “JAN PI TAWA AKESI W”.
When Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather’s name, and had been in the family for a long time,	jan Kitopa Jopin li wile sona tan soweli lili e kon ona, la ona li toki e ni: ni li nimi pi mama mama li ijo pi kulupu mama tan kama pi tenpo suli.
Christopher Robin said you couldn’t be called Trespassers W,	jan Kitopa Jopin li toki e ni: jan li ken ala jo e nimi “jan pi tawa akesi W”.
and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather was,	soweli lili li toki e ni: jan li ken jo tan ni: mama mama ona li jo.
and it was short for Trespassers Will,	ale pi nimi ni li “jan pi tawa akesi Wi”.
which was short for Trespassers William.	ale pi nimi ni li ni: “jan pi tawa akesi WILIJEN”.
And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost one—Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.	mama mama ona li jo e nimi tu tan ken pi ike kama ni: ona li pini jo e wan ona: “JAN PI TAWA IKE” lon pini pi “mama sama”, “WILIJEN” lon pini pi “JAN PI TAWA IKE”.
	
“I’ve got two names,” said Christopher Robin carelessly.	“mi jo e nimi tu” li toki pi jan Kitopa Jopin kepeken pilin ala.
	
“Well, there you are, that proves it,” said Piglet.	“ni. ni li pana e pilin sona” li toki pi soweli lili.
	
One fine winter’s day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house, he happened to look up,	tenpo suno pi tenpo lete, pi pona lukin la soweli pi palisa monsi sike li weka e ko lete tan sinpin pi lupa tomo ona, la tan ken la ona li lukin e sewi.
and there was Winnie-the-Pooh.	ni la soweli Wini Pu li lon.
Pooh was walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else,	soweli Pu li tawa lon poka sike li tawa lon poka sike li toki insa e ijo pi ijo ante.
and when Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.	soweli pi palisa monsi sike li toki wawa tawa ona, la ona li awen tawa a.
	
“Hallo!” said Piglet,	“toki!” li toki pi soweli lili.
“what are you doing?”	“sina pali seme?”
	
“Hunting,” said Pooh.	“mi alasa” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
“Hunting what?”	“sina alasa e seme?” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
“Tracking something,” said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously.	“mi lukin e sitelen noka ijo” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu tan weka sona nasa.
	
“Tracking what?” said Piglet,	“sina lukin e sitelen noka seme?” li toki pi soweli lili.
coming closer.	ona li tawa poka.
	
“That’s just what I ask myself.	“mi toki e ni a tawa mi.
I ask myself, What?”	mi toki e ni tawa mi: seme?”
	
“What do you think you’ll answer?”	“tawa sina la, sina toki sin e seme?”
	
“I shall have to wait	“mi wile awen.
until I catch up with it,” said Winnie-the-Pooh.	mi pini kama e ni: mi alasa e ona” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu.
“Now, look there.”	“o lukin e ni.”
He pointed to the ground in front of him.	ona li palisa e anpa lon sinpin.
“What do you see there?”	“sina lukin e seme?”
	
“Tracks,” said Piglet. “Paw-marks.”	“sitelen noka” li toki pi soweli lili.
He gave a little squeak of excitement.	ona li kalama lili kepeken uta lili, tan pilin pi nasa wawa.
“Oh, Pooh!	“soweli Pu o!
Do you think it’s a—a—a Woozle?”	tawa sina la ni li … ni li … ni li soweli pi kiwen uta wawa anu seme?”
	
“It may be,” said Pooh.	“ken la ni” li toki pi soweli Pu.
“Sometimes it is,	“tenpo wan la ni.
and sometimes it isn’t.	tenpo ante la ala.
You never can tell with paw-marks.”	tenpo ala la jan li ken kama sona e ijo pi sitelen noka.”
	
With these few words he went on tracking,	pini pi nimi ni pi mute ala la ona li awen lukin e sitelen noka.
and Piglet, after watching him for a minute or two, ran after him.	soweli lili li lukin e ona lon tenpo pi mute wan li tawa wawa tawa monsi ona.
Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden stop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way.	soweli Wini Pu li pini tawa lon tenpo lili li kama anpa lon sewi pi sitelen noka li pilin pi weka sona nasa.
	
“What’s the matter?” asked Piglet.	“seme li lon?” li toki pi soweli lili.
	
“It’s a very funny thing,” said Bear,	“ni li ijo nasa” li toki pi soweli pi luka wawa.
“but there seem to be two animals now.	“taso tawa mi la tenpo ni la soweli tu li lon.
This—whatever-it-was—has been joined by another—whatever-it-is—	soweli mu ni li kama lon poka pi soweli mu ante.
and the two of them are now proceeding in company.	soweli tu ni li awen tawa lon poka kulupu.
Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals?”	tawa sina la ni li pona anu seme?: sina tawa lon poka mi — soweli lili o — tan ken ni pi ike kama: ona tu li utala?
	
Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had nothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it really was a Woozle.	soweli lili li luka kiwen e kute li suwi lukin li toki e ni: ona li pali ala lon tenpo suno esun ni li wile kama tan ken ni: ni li lon li soweli pi kiwen uta wawa.
	
“You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,” said Winnie-the-Pooh,	“sina wile toki e ni: ni li soweli tu pi kiwen uta wawa” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu.
and Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday.	soweli lili li toki e ni: taso ona li pali ala lon tenpo suno esun ni.
So off they went together.	ni la ona tu li tawa lon poka kulupu.
	
There was a small spinney of larch trees just here,	mute lili pi kasi suli anpa li lon ni.
and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this spinney;	tawa lukin la soweli tu pi kiwen uta wawa — ona tu li ni la — li tawa lon poka sike pi mute ni pi kasi suli moli.
so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them;	sama ni la soweli Pu en soweli lili pi palisa monsi sike li tawa lon poka sike pi mute ni pi kasi suli moli, lon monsi pi ona tu.
Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking,	soweli pi palisa monsi sike li musi li toki e ni tawa soweli Pu: mama mama pi tawa akesi W li pini lukin e sitelen noka, la ona li wile weka e kiwen tan noka, la ona li pali ona.
and how his Grandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,	sin la ona li toki e ni: sike suno pini ona la mama mama pi tawa akesi W li pilin ike tan weka kon.
and other matters of interest,	sin la ona li toki e ijo ante pi pona sona.
and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was like,	soweli Pu li pilin pi weka sona ni: mama mama li seme?
and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now,	ken la ona tu li alasa e mama mama tu anu seme?
and, if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it,	ni la ona li ken tawa tomo e wan ona li ken awen e ona anu seme?
and what Christopher Robin would say.	jan Kitopa Jopin li toki e seme pi ijo ni?
And still the tracks went on in front of them…	sin la sitelen noka li awen lon sinpin ona…
	
Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him.	tenpo lili la soweli Wini Pu li pini tawa li pilin pi nasa wawa li palisa e sinpin.
“Look!”	“o lukin!”
	
“What?” said Piglet, with a jump.	“e seme?” li toki pi soweli lili li noka e anpa li tawa sewi.
And then, to show that he hadn’t been frightened,	ona li wile sama ni: ona li pilin akesi ala.
he jumped up and down once or twice more	tan ni la ona li noka e anpa li tawa sewi lon tenpo pi wan anu tu.
in an exercising sort of way.	kepeken ni la ona li sama pona e sijelo kepeken tawa.
	
“The tracks!” said Pooh.	“sitelen noka a!” li toki pi soweli Pu.
“A third animal has joined the other two!”	“soweli nanpa mute li kama lon poka pi tu ante!”
	
“Pooh!” cried Piglet.	“soweli Pu o!” li toki wawa pi soweli lili.
“Do you think it is another Woozle?”	“tawa sina la ni li soweli pi kiwen uta wawa ante?”
	
“No,” said Pooh,	“ala” li toki pi soweli Pu.
“because it makes different marks.	“tan ni: ona li lon e sitelen ante.
It is either Two Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle,	ken wan la ni li soweli tu pi kiwen uta wawa en soweli lili wan pi kiwen uta wawa.
or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is, Woozle.	ken ante la ni li soweli lili tu pi kiwen uta wawa en soweli suli wan pi kiwen uta.
Let us continue to follow them.”	mi o awen tawa lon monsi ona.”
	
So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent.	ni la ona tu li awen tawa li pilin lili pi ken ike ni: soweli lon sinpin ona li utala.
And Piglet wished very much that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere,	soweli lili li wile mute e ni: mama mama T W li lon ni li lon ijo ante ala.
and Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so much.	soweli Pu li toki insa e ni: ona li kama lon poka pi jan Kitopa Jopin lon tenpo lili tan ken pi lili ale, tan ni taso: tawa ona la jan Kitopa Jopin li pona mute.
And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before.	ni la tenpo lili la soweli Wini Pu li pini tawa lon tenpo sin li pana e lete li uta e nena pi sinpin lawa kepeken palisa uta tan ni: ona li pilin seli en akesi pi mute nanpa wan.
There were four animals in front of them!	soweli tu tu li lon sinpin ona tu!
	
“Do you see, Piglet?	“sina lukin e ni anu seme?
Look at their tracks!	o lukin e sitelen noka ona!
Three, as it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle.	soweli mute pi kiwen uta wawa en soweli lili pi kiwen uta wawa.
Another Woozle has joined them!”	soweli pi kiwen uta wawa li kama lon poka ona!”
	
And so it seemed to be.	tawa jan la ni li lon.
There were the tracks;	sitelen noka li lon.
crossing over each other here, getting muddled up with each other there;	ona li kama lon poka ante lon ni wan li kama wan nasa lon ni ante.
but, quite plainly every now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.	taso jan li ken lukin pona e ni lon tenpo pi mute wan: sitelen pi noka tu tu tu li lon.
	
“I think,” said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too, and found that it brought very little comfort, “I think that I have just remembered something.	“tawa mi la” — li toki pi soweli lili lon tenpo ni: ona sin li uta e nena pi sinpin lawa, taso tawa ona la ni li pana e pilin pi pona lili — “tawa mi la mi kama sin awen sona e ijo.
I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan’t be able to do to-morrow.	mi kama sin awen sona e ijo, mi pini sona e ona lon tenpo suno pini, mi ken ala pali e ona lon tenpo suno kama.
So I suppose I really ought to go back	tan ni la mi wile tawa monsi.
and do it now.”	mi wile pali e ona lon tenpo ni.”
	
“We’ll do it this afternoon,	“mi tu li pali e ona lon pini pi tenpo suno ni.
and I’ll come with you,” said Pooh.	mi tawa lon poka sina” li toki pi soweli Pu.
	
“It isn’t the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,” said Piglet quickly.	“jan li ken ala pali e ona ni lon pini pi tenpo suno” li toki pi soweli lili lon tenpo lili.
“It’s a very particular morning thing,	“ona li ijo wan pi kama pi tenpo suno.
that has to be done in the morning,	jan li wile pali e ona lon kama pi tenpo suno.
and, if possible, between the hours of—	jan li ken, la ona o pali e ona lon —
What would you say the time was?”	tawa sina la wan seme pi tenpo suno li lon?”
	
“About twelve,” said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun.	“poka pi insa pi tenpo suno li lon” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu, ona li lukin e suno.
	
“Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five.	“lon — ni li toki mi — insa pi tenpo suno.
So, really, dear old Pooh, if you’ll excuse me—What’s that?”	tan ni la ni la jan pona Pu o, sina wile weka e ike mi, la — seme li lon?”
	
Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he looked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his.	soweli Pu li lukin e sewi li kute e kalama kon uta lon tenpo sin, la ona li lukin e sewi e palisa pi kasi suli li kama lukin e jan pona ona.
	
“It’s Christopher Robin,” he said.	“ni li jan Kitopa Jopin” li toki ona.
	
“Ah, then you’ll be all right,” said Piglet.	“a, ni la sina pona” li toki pi soweli lili.
“You’ll be quite safe with him.	“sina pona lon poka ona.
Good-bye,”	mi tawa.”
and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very glad to be Out of All Danger again.	ona li tawa weka tawa tomo li pilin pona tan ni: ona li pilin pi pona mute tan ni: oni li lon weka pi ken pi ike kama.
	
Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree.	jan Kitopa Jopin li kama anpa tan kasi suli ona.
	
“Silly old Bear,” he said,	“soweli nasa pi luka wawa o” li toki ona.
“what were you doing?	“sina pali e seme?
First you went round the spinney twice by yourself,	tenpo nanpa wan la sina tawa lon poka sike pi mute pi kasi suli moli.
and then Piglet ran after you	pini ni la soweli lili li tawa wawa tawa monsi sina.
and you went round again together,	sina tu li tawa lon poka sike, lon tenpo sin, lon poka kulupu.
and then you were just going round a fourth time—”	sin la sina tu li tawa lon poka sike lon tenpo nanpa tu tu.”
	
“Wait a moment,” said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw.	“o awen lili” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu, ona li sewi e luka.
	
He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think.	ona li kama anpa lon supa li toki insa pi wawa mute.
Then he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks…	pini ni la ona li lon sitelen luka e luka.
and then he scratched his nose twice, and stood up.	pini ni la ona li luka kiwen e nena pi sinpin lawa lon tenpo tu li kama sinpin.
	
“Yes,” said Winnie-the-Pooh.	“lon” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu.
	
“I see now,” said Winnie-the-Pooh.	“mi sona lon tenpo ni” li toki pi soweli Wini Pu.
	
“I have been Foolish and Deluded,” said he,	“mi nasa” li toki ona.
“and I am a Bear of No Brain at All.”	“mi soweli pi luka wawa, pi lawa pi ala ale.”
	
“You’re the Best Bear in All the World,” said Christopher Robin soothingly.	“sina soweli pi luka wawa, pi pona nanpa wan” li toki suwi pi jan Kitopa Jopin.
	
“Am I?” said Pooh hopefully.	“mi ni anu seme?” li toki pi soweli Pu, ona li pilin pi ken pi pona kama.
And then he brightened up suddenly.	ni la ona li kama sin pilin pona lon tenpo lili.
	
“Anyhow,” he said,	“mu” li toki ona.
“it is nearly Luncheon Time.”	“tenpo moku li kama.”
	
So he went home for it.	ni la ona li tawa tomo tawa moku.
